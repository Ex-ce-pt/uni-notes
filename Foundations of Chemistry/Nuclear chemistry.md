2 forces are at play in an atom's nucleus: $p^+-p^+$ repulsion & strong force.
Strong force acts on very short distances but is greater than the repulsion force.
As atoms grow larger, they need more $n^0$ to contribute to strong force without adding more changed particles.

**Nuclear reaction** - reaction that operates on the composition of the nucleus of atoms.
**Daughter nucleus** - the product of the nuclear reaction.
**Radioactive** - spontaneously undergoing a nuclear reaction and emitting radiation.
**Nuclear transmutation** - conversion of an atom of one element to an atom of another element via a nuclear reaction.

A lot of energy is involved in nuclear reactions.

Radioactive isotopes of heavy elements tend to decompose in a **radioactive series**.

> The most important thing to remember in nuclear reactions is that the total \# of nucleons on both sides of the equation should be the same.

## Radiation types

#### Alpha decay

Particle emitted: $_2^4\alpha \space / \space \ce{_2^4He^{2+}}$
Shielding required: paper, skin.

Emitted by large nuclei, $Z > 82$.
Very few nuclei for which $Z < 60$ emit $\alpha$-particles.

Effects:
- $A \rightarrow A - 4$
- $Z \rightarrow Z - 2$

Example:
$\ce{_{88}^{226}Ra -> _{86}^{222}Rn + _2^4\alpha}$

#### Beta decay

Particle emitted: $\ce{_{-1}^0\beta \space / _{-1}^0e}$
Shielding required: $3 \space mm$ aluminium.

$n^0$ turns into $p^+$ and $e^-$.
Emitted by $n^0$-rich nuclei.

Effects:
- $A \rightarrow A$
- $Z \rightarrow Z + 1$

Example:
$\ce{_6^{14}C -> _7^{14}N + _{-1}^0e}$

#### Gamma decay

Particle emitted: photon of high frequency.
Shielding required: concrete, lead.

Usually accompanying other types of radiation or when emitting the energy of an excited state.

Effects:
- $A \rightarrow A$
- $Z \rightarrow Z$

#### Positron emission

Particle emitted: $\ce{_{+1}^0\beta \space / _{+1}^0e}$
Shielding required: ??

$p^+$ turns into $n^0$ and $e^+$.

Effects:
- $A \rightarrow A$
- $Z \rightarrow Z - 1$

Example:
$\ce{_{11}^{22}Na -> _{10}^{22}Ne + _{+1}^0e}$

#### Electron capture

Particle emitted: none
Shielding required: ??

An outside $e^-$ merges with a $p^+$, turning into a $n^0$.

Effects:
- $A \rightarrow A$
- $Z \rightarrow Z - 1$

Example:
$\ce{_{20}^{41}Ca + _{-1}^0e -> _{19}^{41}K}$

## Predicting radiation types

Can only predict likely radiation types, atoms can emit different kinds of radiation.

| Condition      | Likely radiation type                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Too many $p^+$ | [[#Positron emission]]/[[#Electron capture]] |
| Too many $n^0$ | [[#Beta decay]]                              |
| Too big atoms  | [[#Alpha decay]]                             |
| Too excited    | [[#Gamma decay]]                             |

## Nuclear stability

Magic numbers: $2$, $8$, $20$, $50$, $82$, $114$, $126$, $184$.

Isotopes appear to be stable when the \# of either $p^+$ or $n^0$ corresponds to a magic number.

**Band of stability** - straight line on the plot of $A$ against $Z$ where the stable nuclei reside.
**Sea of instability** - the majority of combinations of the values of $A$ and $Z$ yield an unstable nucleus.

## Rate of nuclear decay

**Geiger counter** - device for measuring radiation via observing its interaction /w an inert gas.
**Scintillation counter** - device for measuring radiation using photosensitive substances.

Unit: becquerel ($Bq$), $Bq = \frac{\text{\# of radioctive decays}}{\text{time}}$.

Nuclear decay is a first-order reaction, rate: $k \cdot N$

$N = N_0 \cdot e^{-kt}, \space t_{1/2} = \frac{ln(2)}{k}$

| Symbol    | Unit     | Explanation                               |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| $N$       | $-$      | \# of atoms left at a given point in time |
| $N_0$     | $-$      | Initial \# of atoms                       |
| $k$       | $s^{-1}$ | Rate constant for the radioactive decay   |
| $t$       | $s$      | A given point in time                     |
| $t_{1/2}$ | $s$      | Half-life of radioactive decay            |

If you're a normal person:
$N = N_0 \cdot 2^{-\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}}$

| $t$       | $s$      | A given point in time                     |
