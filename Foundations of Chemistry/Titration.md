**Titration** - analytical technique where one solution is gradually added to another.

Types:
- Acid-base
- Redox

Focusing on **acid-base** titrations from now on.

**Analyte** - solution being analyzed (in a flask).
**Titrant** - solution being added (in a buret).

## Process

Known: $V_a$, $c_t$
Measure: $c_a$ or $m_a$
Process:
1. $V_a$ of the analyte is measured into a flask.
2. $V_{t1}$ of the titrant is taken into a buret.
3. The titrant is added bit by bit into the flask until the analyte stops reacting.
4. $V_{t2}$ is measured from the buret (the final volume reading).
5. $(V_{t1} - V_{t2})$ of the titrant was added in total.
6. $n_t = c_t \cdot (V_{t1} - V_{t2})$ - amount of titrant added.
7. $n_a = n_t \cdot \text{(mole ratio)}$ - amount of analyte that reacted (all $V_a$ of it), mole ratio comes from the chem. eq.
8. $c_a = \frac{n_a}{V_a}$ **OR** $m_a = n_a \cdot M_a$

**Equivalence point (stoichiometric point)** - the point of where the amount of $\ce{H+}$/$\ce{OH-}$ added is equal to the amount of $\ce{OH-}$/$\ce{H+}$ initially present.
**Endpoint** - the point at which a sudden measurable change happens that prompts the chemist to stop the titration process (e.g. indicator changing color).

## Strong acid-base titration

The analyte and titrant are a strong acid & base.

Stoichiometric point: $pH = 7$
$pH$ changes very abruptly around the stoichiometric point.

> When calculating the new $pH$ of the analyte at different points of the titration, don't forget to add up the initial volume of the analyte and the volume of the titrant added to get the volume of the analyte at the given point.

## Strong acid-weak base or weak acid-strong base titrations

The $pH$ of the analyte at the stoichiometric point depends on the ions present.
Strong acid-weak base → moderate conjugate acid ions → $pH < 7$.
Weak acid-strong base → moderate conjugate base ions → $pH > 7$.

Around the $pKa$ of the acid/base the change in $pH$ slows down - the weak acid/base forms a buffer.

**Halfway point of titration** - $\ce{[HA]} = \ce{[A-]}$
