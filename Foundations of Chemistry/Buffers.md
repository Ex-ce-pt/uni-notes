Solution: $\ce{CH3COOH, CH3COONa}$
Species: $\ce{CH3COOH} \text{ (weak acid), } \ce{CH3COO-} \text{ (moderate base), } \ce{Na+} \text{ (effectively neutral)}$
Dissociation reaction: $\ce{CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) \rightleftharpoons CH3COO- (aq) + H3O+ (aq)}$

Preparation:
1. $\ce{CH3COOH}$ added to water. The acid partially dissociates. $pH \rightarrow pKa(\ce{CH3COOH})$.
2. $\ce{CH3COONa}$ added to the solution. The salt dissociates into $\ce{CH3COO-}$ and $\ce{Na+}$. The sodium cations have no effect.
3. The addition of new anions makes the dissociation reaction go in the direction of protonation. More $\ce{H3O+}$ used up. $pH$ lowered (basic effect of $\ce{CH3COO-}$). New equilibrium reached.

Addition of acid:
1. A little of $\ce{HCl}$ is added to the solution. The acid dissociates into $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$. The chloride anions have no effect.
2. The new $\ce{H3O+}$ makes the dissociation reaction go in the direction of protonation. More $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{CH3COO-}$ used up. New $\ce{H3O+}$ is trapped by $\ce{CH3COO-}$. The $pH$ effect is counteracted. New equilibrium reached.
3. This process continues as long as there are $\ce{CH3COO-}$ ions present in the solution.

$\ce{CH3COO-}$ - proton sink.

Addition of base:
1. A little $\ce{NaOH}$ is added to the solution. The base dissociates into $\ce{OH-}$ and $\ce{Na+}$. The sodium cations have no effect.
2. The new $\ce{OH-}$ deprotonates $\ce{CH3COOH}$ in a reaction: $\ce{CH3COOH (aq) + OH- (aq) -> CH3COO- (aq) + H2O (l)}$. $\ce{OH-}$ and $\ce{CH3COOH}$ used up. New $\ce{OH-}$ is trapped in water. The $pH$ effect is counteracted. New equilibrium is reached.
3. This process will continue as long as there are $\ce{CH3COOH}$ molecules present in the solution.

$\ce{CH3COOH}$ - proton source.

**Buffer** - solution of a weak acid/base and its salt that counteracts the $pH$ change from an addition of a small amount of a strong acid/base.
**Acid buffer** - buffer of a weak acid and its salt. Works at $pH < 7$. $\ce{CH3COOH + CH3COONa}$
**Base buffer (alkaline buffer)** - buffer of a weak base and its salt. Works at $pH > 7$. $\ce{NH3 + NH4Cl}$

Buffers are important in environmental science, medicine, and microbiology.

> A lot of approximations can be done when working w/ buffers!

Usually buffers are prepared using equal amounts of acid/base and the salt, because then the amount of proton sinks/sources is the most balanced and the buffer is the most effective.
**Equimolar solution** - solution of solutes in equal amounts.
For an equimolar buffer:
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\textcolor{grey}{\ce{[A-]}_{\text{initial}} = \ce{[HA]}_{\text{initial}} \text{ - since equimolar}} \\
&\textcolor{grey}{\ce{[A-]} \approx \ce{[A-]}_{\text{initial}}, \space \ce{[HA]} \approx \ce{[HA]}_{\text{initial}} \text{ - assumption}} \\
&\textcolor{grey}{K_a = \frac{\ce{[A-][H3O+]}}{\ce{[HA]}} \approx \frac{\ce{[A-]}_{\text{initial}}\ce{[H3O+]}}{\ce{[HA]}_{\text{initial}}} \approx \ce{[H3O+]}} \\
&pKa \approx pH
&\end{flalign}
$$

More acid → lower $pH$
More base → higher $pH$

**Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**
$pH \approx pK_a + log(\frac{\ce{[A-]}_{\text{initial}}}{\ce{[HA]}_{\text{initial}}})$

Works for both acid & base buffers, just remember which of the species is a base and which is an acid.

**Buffer capacity** - how much acid/base can the buffer withstand before the $pH$ starts changing significantly.

Concentrated buffer → higher buffer capacity
High buffer capacity against acid: $\frac{[\text{weak base}]}{[\text{weak acid}]} \geq 0.1$, $pH \geq pK_a - 1$
High buffer capacity against base: $\frac{[\text{weak acid}]}{[\text{weak base}]} \geq 0.1$, $pH \leq pK_a + 1$

> A buffer is most effective when $(pK_a - 1) < pH < (pK_a + 1)$.

> Molecules that have both acidic & basic groups can also form buffer solutions.
