The stronger the interactions, the higher the melting & boiling points of the compound ([[States of matter]]).
Interactions here are listed in decreasing order of strength.

> Life is hard. Compounds almost always have multiple different interaction types (eg. when there's a [hydrogen bond](#Hydrogen%20bonding), there's necessarily a [dipole-dipole](#Dipole-dipole%20interaction) bond as well). What's usually important is which interaction is the strongest.

Solubility: solvent and solute must have the same type of intermolecular forces between them.

| State of matter | Movement of particles | Intermolecular forces | Kinetic Energy |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Gas             | Free                  | Little to no          | High           |
| Liquid          | Some sliding          | Considerable          | Medium         |
| Solid           | None                  | Strong                | Low            |
States of matter depend on the interplay between the kinetic energy of particles and strength of intermolecular forces.

> $E$ here is the Coulombic potential ($E = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}$),
> not potential energy from Coulomb law ($E = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$)!

## Coulombic/ionic/electrostatic

Between: charged ions.
Described by the Coulomb's law, acts equally in all directions.
Scales: $\textcolor{yellow}{E \propto \frac{1}{r}}$ - long-range.
Strength: strong, $100s \space \frac{kJ}{mol}$.
Small ions (little atomic radius) /w high charges → strong interactions.

$\ce{Mg^{2+}O^{2-}} > \ce{Li+F-} > \ce{Na+Cl-}$

## Ion-dipole

Between: ions & polar molecules.
Scales: $\textcolor{yellow}{E = \propto \frac{1}{r^2}}$.
Strength: $10.0-20.0 \space \frac{kJ}{mol}$.

Example: dissolving salts in water.

## Hydrogen bonding

Special case of [Keesom interaction](#Keesom/Dipole-dipole%20interaction).
$\ce{H}$ bonded **directly** to a very $e^-$-neg. atom ($\ce{N}$, $\ce{O}$, $\ce{F}$) - very polarized bond.
Scales: $\textcolor{yellow}{E \propto \frac{1}{r^2}}$.
Strength: $15.0-20.0 \frac{kJ}{mol}$.

Dipoles between the molecules attract each other, holding the whole mass of the substance together.

## Keesom/Dipole-dipole interaction

Between: polarized molecules.
Scales: $\textcolor{yellow}{E \propto \frac{1}{r^3}}$ (in solids), $\textcolor{yellow}{E \propto \frac{1}{r^6}}$(in liquids & gases) - short-range.
Strength: $0.0-2.0 \space \frac{kJ}{mol}$.

The stronger the dipole, the stronger the interaction.

## Debye (dipole-induced dipole) interaction

Between: polarized molecules & neutral molecules.
Strength: $0.0-2.0 \space \frac{kJ}{mol}$.

Permanent dipole induces a dipole in an otherwise neutral molecule.
Works best when the neutral molecule has a big $e^-$ cloud/multiple bonds/weakly bonded $e^-$.

## London dispersion forces

Scales: $\textcolor{yellow}{E \propto \frac{1}{r^6}}$ - very short-range.
Strength: $0.0-2.0 \space \frac{kJ}{mol}$.

Temporary dipole forces arising from coincidental gathering of electron(s) on one side of a molecule, making it ever so slightly polar.
**Always present**.

More $e^-$ → stronger.
Bigger atoms → stronger.
Multiple bonds (rigid) → weaker.
Increases with the radius of the atom.
