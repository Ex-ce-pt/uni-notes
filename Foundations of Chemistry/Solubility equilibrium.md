Solubility product ($K_{sp}$) - equilibrium constant between ionic solid & ions in the solution.
$\ce{Bi2S3 (s) \rightleftharpoons 2 Bi^{3+} (aq) + 3 S^{2-} (aq)}, \space K_{sp} = (a_{\ce{Bi^{3+}}})^2(a_{\ce{S^{2-}}})^3 = \ce{[Bi^{3+}]^2[S^{2-}]^3}$

In general:
$K_{sp} = (a_{\text{cation}})^x(a_{\ce{anion}})^y = [\text{cation}]^x [\text{anion}]^y$

Only applicable to **sparingly soluble salts**! Because the ion-ion interactions are very strong.

$K_{sp}$ can be determined from the molar solubility of the compound.

$$
\begin{flalign}
&\ce{Ag2CrO4 (s) \rightleftharpoons 2 Ag+ (aq) + CrO4^{2-} (aq)} \\
&\ce{[Ag+]} = 2s, \space \ce{[CrO4^{2-}]} = s \\
&K_{sp} = \ce{[Ag+]}^2 \ce{[CrO4^{2-}]} = (2s)^2(s) = 4s^3
&\end{flalign}
$$

## Common ion effect

2 salts are dissolved
salts have an ion in common
the solubility of the salts is lower than if they were the only solute

pH effect - solubility of some salts depends on the pH of the solution

## Precipitation

$Q_{sp} > K_{sp}$
