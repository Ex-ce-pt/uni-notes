**Molecule** - combination of multiple bonded atoms.

## Bond types

| Bond type          | Electron sharing | Electrostatic forces        | Example                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Non-polar covalent | + (equal)        | Between subatomic particles | $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{O2}$   |
| Polar covalent     | + (shifted)      | Between subatomic particles | $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{CO2}$ |
| Ionic              | -                | Between whole ions          | $\ce{Na+Cl-}$          |

No clear boundaries between different bonds - it's a spectrum.
The distinction between bond types is usually drawn using [electronegativity](#Pauling%20electronegativity)

## Covalent bond

Competing forces:
- $e^--p^+$ attraction - dominating, because atoms are big and electrons are smeared all over them.
- $p^+-p^+$ repulsion - weaker, because the nucleus is very concentrated and a lot smaller than the full atom + electrons shield the nuclear charge.
- $e^--e^-$ repulsion

$\Delta E$ - the energy/strength of the bond.
$r_0$ - bond length at $0K$ (absolute minimum of energy, the most stable state possible).

With temperature (additional energy) the bond length starts to vary.
If $\Delta E$ or more energy is supplied, the bond is broken - **cracking**.

Non-polar bond occurs between identical atoms, e.g. diatomic molecules: $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{O2}$, $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{F2}$, etc.
Polar bond occurs between different atoms.

Dipol arrow points from + to -.

**Dipol** - system with 2 electric poles.
We can talk about a bond having a dipol or about a molecule being a dipole itself.
These should not be mixed up.
In the case of $\ce{HF}$, it's both.

## Ionic bond

Bond between a cation and an anion.
Since electrostatic forces act in all directions, the geometry of the bond doesn't matter.
Important: length of the bond.

## Pauling electronegativity

**Electronegativity** - propensity of an atom to attract $e^-$.
There are various systems and values for $e^-$-neg., **Pauling electronegativity** is used the most.

Most electronegative elements: $\ce{N}$, $\ce{O}$, $\ce{F}$
Least electronegative element: $\ce{Fr}$

Electronegativity grows towards the top right corner of the periodic table.

$\Delta \chi = |a - b|$ - difference between $e^-$-neg. of 2 atoms.

| Compound      | $\Delta \chi$ | Bond type          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| $\ce{H2}$     | $0.0$         | non-polar covalent |
| $\ce{H-F}$    | $1.9$         | polar covalent     |
| $\ce{Na+Cl-}$ | $2.1$         | ionic              |
| $\ce{Fr+Cl-}$ | $3.3$         | ionic              |

| $\Delta \chi$ | Bond type                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| $< 0.5$       | non-polar covalent                     |
| $0.5 - 1.6$   | polar covalent                         |
| $1.6 - 2.0$   | depends, polar covalent for non-metals |
| $> 2.0$       | ionic                                  |

| Bond       | $\Delta \chi$ | $\Delta E \space (kJ/mol)$, energy of the bond |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| $\ce{O-O}$ | $0.0$         | $145$                                          |
| $\ce{O-N}$ | $0.5$         | $200$                                          |
| $\ce{O-C}$ | $1.0$         | $360$                                          |
More polarized bond → stronger bond.

| Bond              | $\ce{C-C}$ | Aromatic | $\ce{C=C}$ | $\ce{C#C}$ |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Length            | longer     |          |            | shorter    |
| Strength          | weaker     |          |            | stronger   |
| Energy ($kJ/mol$) | 348        | 518      | 612        | 837        |

## Lewis structures

Structures for representing the bonds and shared electrons.

> Lewis structures assume we're dealing with covalent bonds! Whether the bond is covalent or not should be checked beforehand!

Dots - electrons.
Pairs of dots - electron pairs.
Instead of a pair of dots, lines can be used.

**Octet rule** - an atom wants to have 8 $e^-$ on its valence shell by donating/accepting/sharing $e^-$ /w other atoms. Not applicable for 1st period.
**Hypervalent** - more than 8 $e^-$ on the valence shell.

Rules:
1. Count total \# of valence $e^-$.
2. Put the least $e^-$-neg. element in the center (except $\ce{H}$).
3. Bond all atoms once.
4. Add $e^-$ to terminal atoms to make octets.
5. Give leftover $e^-$ to the central atom.
6. Make octets by using multiple bonds.
7. Minimize charges.
	Charge is the \# of $e^-$ relative to what this atom has normally. Count $1e^-$ per a bond.
	If possible, create more bonds to neutralize adjacent charges.
8. No hypervalent 2nd row elements.
