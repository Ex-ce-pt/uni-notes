## Effective nuclear charge

[Z](Atom,%20orbitals#Effective%20nuclear%20charge)
(For valence electrons)
right → $Z_{\text{eff}}$ increases (same core electrons, $Z$ increases).
down → $Z_{\text{eff}}$ decreases (more shells, more core electrons).

## Atomic radius

The effect is large!

right -> decreases (more protons pulling on the same \# of shells).
down -> increases (more shells).

## Ionization energy

[E_I](Atom,%20orbitals#Cations)
right → increases (effective nuclear charge holds $e^-$ tighter)
down → decreases (new shells are further from the nucleus)

## Electron affinity

[E_A](Atom,%20orbitals#Anions)
*(Generally)*
right → increases (less $e^-$ needed to complete the octet)
down → decreases (easier to remove $e^-$ rather than accept them)

$E_A$ is negative when an orbital is filled /w either lone or paired $e^-$:
$\ce{Be, N, Ne, ...}$
