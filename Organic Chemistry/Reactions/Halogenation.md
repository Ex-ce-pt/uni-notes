**Reagents:**
- Alkane/alkene/alkyne
- Halogen

**Mechanisms:**
- [Radical reaction](Radical%20reactions)

**Requirements:**
- UV light ($h\nu$)

**Notes:**
- $\ce{F2}$ - explosive; treats all the hydrogens as almost equal.
- $\ce{Cl2}$ - controllable; chaotically unselective.
- $\ce{Br2}$ - slow; selective towards the most stable radical.
- $\ce{I2}$ - does not react.
