Radicals have the same stability order as carbocations & are usually $sp^2$ hybridized.

## Formation of radicals

The bond is broken homolytically - each group gets its own $e^-$.
[Radicals](Reaction%20intermediates#Radicals)

**Homolytic bond dissociation energy ($DH \degree$)** - how much energy is needed to homolytically break a bond.

Radicals can form using **light** (e.g. halogens), **heat** (e.g. peroxides), or **both**.

Stability & reactivity of radicals:
$\text{benzylic} > \text{allylic} > 3 \degree > 2 \degree > 1 \degree > 0 \degree > \text{vynillic}$

## Reactions

Steps of radical reactions:
1. **Initiation (endothermic)** - first radicals are formed.
2. **Propagation** - radicals react with molecules, creating products and new radicals.
3. **Termination (exothermic)** - the leftover radicals react together and stop the reaction.

> Radicals are extremely reactive, so unless there is a large excess of the starting material, the radical can replace any and however many of the hydrogens.

**Hammond postulate:**
Exothermic reaction - transition resembles the starting material.
Endothermic reaction - transition state resembles the product.

Since carbon radicals are $sp^2$ hybridized, the other radicals can add from either side, forming a **racemic mixture**.

radicals can add to double bonds, because double bonds are easier to break
follows Markovnikov's rule
antimarkovnikov - add peroxide

peroxides - need heat
