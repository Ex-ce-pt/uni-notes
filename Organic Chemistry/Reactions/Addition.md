pi bond easier to brake than sigma bond
alkenes can act as lewis bases - donating electrons

addition reactions are often initiated by the addition of H+

markovnikov's rule - hydrogen goes to the carbon with more hydrogens
creates a more stable crbocation

since carbocations are planar, racemic mixture is formed


ozonolysis

catalytic hydrogenation - cis addition

hydroboration

oxymercuration-demercuration
