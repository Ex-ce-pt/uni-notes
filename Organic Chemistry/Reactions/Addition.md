**Addition:** $\ce{A + B -> A-B}$

Often addition reactions happen with alkenes, because a $\pi$ bond is easier to brake than a $\sigma$ bond.
Alkenes can act as Lewis bases - donating $e^-$ from their $\pi$ bonds.

Reactions are often initiated by an **acid catalyst**.

A lot of addition reaction are described in the notes for the classes of compounds they belong to. Here it's mainly the addition reactions to alkenes.

## Hydrohalogenation

**Reagents:**
- Alkene/Alkyne
- Hydrogen halide ($\ce{H-X}$)

**Requirements:**
- None

**Product:** **racemic mixture**

Follows **Markovnikov's rule**.
Racemic mixture is formed because of the creation of a carbocation.
Also, rearrangements are possible.

## Halogenation

See [[Reactions/Halogenation|Halogenation]] for radical reactions.

**Reagents:**
- Alkene
- Halogen ($\ce{X-X}$)

**Requirements:**
- None

**Product:** **racemic mixture**

**Anti addition**.
This can be explained by the reaction mechanism.
**Stereospecific reaction** - certain isomer → certain isomer.

The intermediate: **bromonium ion**.
The 2nd step is [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2)-like.

> In the 2nd step, any nucleophile (including water) can react, adding its own respective group.

> The 1st bromide atom bonds to the alkene in a **Markovnikov fashion**.
> It bonds to the carbon with most hydrogen atoms (least substituted one).
> This is because the most substituted carbon resembles a stable carbocation more, and so the nucleophile prefers to add to it.

## Ozonolysis

**Reagents:**
- Alkene (useful, if cyclic) / Alkyne
- $\ce{O3}$
- $\ce{Zn/AcOH}$

**Requirements:**
- None

**Products:** broken bond, **aldehyde** on its place, from alkene, or **carboxylic acid**, from alkyne.

**Pericyclic reaction** - the transition state has more rings that the starting compounds.
Double bond cleaved, $sp^2$ carbons connected to oxygen atoms with double bonds instead (**aldehyde**).
**All** double/triple bonds are broken!

## Cis dihydroxylation

For trans-, see: [[Ethers and epoxides#Anti dihydroxylation]]

**Reagents:**
- Alkene
- $\ce{OsO4/KMnO4}$
- $\ce{H2O}$

**Requirements:**
- None

**Products:** cis-adduct of 2 hydroxyl groups.
