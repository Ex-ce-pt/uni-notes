Need a good **leaving group** to stabilize the negative charge.
Need an $e^-$-rich atom to donate an $e^-$-pair and form a bond - **nucleophile**.

Both reactions depend on the leaving group: the reaction happens, if the reactant (nucleophile) is a stronger nucleophile than the leaving group.

The reactions happen because the bonds are polarized. Nucleophiles are attracted to the positively charged carbon atoms and bond to them, displacing the weaker nucleophiles - leaving groups.

> Alkenyl & aryl halides do not react via nucleophilic substitution.

## SN1

Happens in multiple steps:
1. Carbocation spontaneously formed (slow, **rate-determining step**).
2. Nucleophile bonded - its group is positively charged.
3. A group leaves the nucleophile group relieving it of the positive charge.

Usually between bulky alkylhalides (e.g. tertiary carbocations) & weak nucleophiles.
Moderate temperatures (room temperature).
Competes w/ E1 reactions.

**Rate**: $k_r \ce{[\text{substrate}]}$
**Products in stereochemistry**: **racemic mixture** of the stereoisomers.

> Carbocations are $sp^2$ hybridized, thus planar, which means that the nucleophile can attack the positively charged carbon from either side with similar likelihood. This is the reason a racemic mixture is formed.

**Reactivity of carbocations**: $0 \degree (\text{methane}) < 1 \degree < 2 \degree < 3 \degree$

> Since the formation of a carbocation is needed, the reaction cannot happen, if the cation cannot form.

**Solvolysis** - a reactant reacting with a solvent.
**Hydrolysis** - solvolysis w/ water.
**Methanolysis** - solvolysis w/ methanol.

## SN2

Happens in a single step (concerted reaction):
- The leaving group takes the $e^-$ from the bond & leaves; the nucleophile bonds to the carbon.

Usually w/ strong nucleophiles: strong bases, conjugate bases of weak acids, etc.
Moderate temperatures (room temperature).

![[_media/Nucleophilic substitution/SN2-example.png]]

**Rate**: $k_r \ce{[\text{substrate}][\text{nucleophile}]}$
**Products in stereochemistry**: the absolute configuration is inversed: 
- *R* → *S*
- *S* → *R*

The nucleophile must come from the side opposite to the side the leaving group leaves from, because the nucleophile bonds to the antibonding orbital in the bond between the carbon atom and the leaving group.
The mechanism of the reaction can be shown with a transition state:

**Reactivity of carbocations**: $0 \degree (\text{methane}) > 1 \degree > 2 \degree > 3 \degree (\text{unreactive})$

==Q: if tertiary cations are unreactive, why do we care about configuration?

>In tertiary carbocation it's hard for the nucleophile to access the carbon, since it has to approach from the opposite direction.
>**Steric hindrance** - when the spatial arrangement of groups slows or stops the reaction.

#### Using the acidic environment

Some reactions (e.g. SN2 reaction with $\ce{OH-}$ as a leaving group) are impossible on their own.
Acids can be used to protonate the bad leaving groups to make them good leaving groups.
Usually this means protonating an alcohol.

## Nucleophiles

Nucleophiles are more reactive when they are... (generally, less stable):
1. Negatively charged: $\ce{OH-} > \ce{H2O}; \space \ce{RO-} > \ce{ROH}$
2. More basic: $\ce{RO-} > \ce{OH-} > \ce{RCO2-} > \ce{ROH} > \ce{H2O}$
3. In the same row of the periodic table, more electronegative: $\ce{R3C-} > \ce{R2N-} > \ce{RO-} > \ce{F-}$
4. In the same group, more downwards: $\ce{I-} > \ce{Br-} > \ce{Cl-} > \ce{F-} ; \space \ce{RS-} > \ce{RO-}$

==NOTE: how is I- a better nucleophile than Cl-?

==larger = better?
