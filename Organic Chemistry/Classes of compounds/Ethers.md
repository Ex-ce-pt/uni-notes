**General form:**
$\ce{R-O-R'}$

**Sensitive to acids (hydrolysis), inert to bases.**

This makes them good polar aprotic solvents for reactions in basic conditions.

Most ethers can form peroxides over time in a [radical reaction](Radical%20reactions) w/ oxygen.

## Protection of hydroxyl groups

Hydroxyl groups in [[Classes of compounds/Alcohols|Alcohols]] can react in acid-base reactions or other reactions.
When synthesizing a compound w/ multiple functional groups, it might be necessary to carry out a reaction that might disturb the hydroxyl group.
For it to stay intact, it is protected by converting it to an ether.

It is also possible to protect hydroxyl groups by turning them into silyl ethers:

Either $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{F-}$ can be used to deprotect the compound in the case of silyl protection.

## Epoxides

General form:
```smiles
[R]C1OC1[R]
```

React w/ both acids and bases because of the large ring strain.

#### Acid-catalyzed ring opening

Usually, a weak nucleophile is used (e.g. the solvent $\ce{H2O, CH3OH, ...}$)
The epoxide is first protonated, which creates a partial carbocation on a **more substituted carbon**, then the nucleophile attacks the carbon from the backside.
The reaction can also be considered to be somewhat an [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2) reaction, which explains it.

#### Base-catalyzed ring opening

Only happens in epoxides.

Usually, a strong nucleophile is used (commonly an alkoxide).
The nucleophile attacks a **less substituted carbon**.
The reaction takes place via the [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2) mechanism.

#### Anionic polymerization

Epoxides can form polyethers when reacting w/ an alkoxide & a small amount of alcohol:

#### Anti dihydroxylation

Epoxidation + [[#Acid-catalyzed ring opening]] → anti 1,2-dihydroxylation
