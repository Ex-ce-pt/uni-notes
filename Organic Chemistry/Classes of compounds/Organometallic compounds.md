Metals bonded to an organic chain.
Adding a metal to an $e^-$-poor $\ce{C}$ makes it $e^-$-rich.
Can be viewed as a metallic cation & a [carbanion](Reaction%20intermediates#Carbanions).

> aka. **Grignard reagents**

**Interactions:**

| $\ce{Li}$    | $\ce{Mg, Zn, Cd}$  | $\ce{Pb, Sn, Hg}$ |

## Synthesis

> Before the synthesis, refer to [[#Risks]]!

Usually synthesized from alkyl halides by the addition of the appropriate solid metal.

## Reactions

#### With carbonyls

The most common use of Grignard reagents.

Carbonyl → alcohol

With esters:

Notice how the $\ce{R''}$ group is actually lost.

#### With carbon dioxide

A fairly common reaction use to create carboxylic acids.

#### Extending the carbon chain

Since these compounds are essentially carbanions, they can be used in the [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2) reactions (with e.g. alkyl halides) to extend the carbon chain.

#### Deuterium-labeling

It might be useful to replace a certain hydrogen atom in a molecule with deuterium.
For that, Grignard reagents may be used.

## Risks

Grignard reagents are **extremely strong nucleophiles** and will deprotonate the solvent, if it's protic. So use **only aprotic solvents**.

---

Avoid groups on the starting material that can easily be deprotonated, because chances are the Grignard reagents are going to react with them instead:
$\ce{-OH, -NH2, -NHR, -COOH, -CC#H}$

---

(Somewhat obvious but still)
The Grignard reagents themselves must not have carbonyl groups in them when they are prepared. Otherwise, they are going to react with themselves - autocondensation.

## Cuprates

Compounds involving copper.
Can be used to bond 2 different alkyl chains together, but also looses some of the groups along the way.
