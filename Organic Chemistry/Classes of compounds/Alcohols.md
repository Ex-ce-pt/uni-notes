**General form:**
$\ce{R-OH}$

**Classification:**
- $1 \degree$ → $\ce{CH2(R)-OH}$
- $2 \degree$ → $\ce{CH(R_1)(R_2)-OH}$
- $3 \degree$ → $\ce{C(R_1)(R_2)(R_3)-OH}$

Intermolecular interactions: hydrogen bonding, London dispersion.

Relatively elevated boiling point.
Solubility in water:
- More $\ce{-OH}$ groups → more soluble.
- Bigger alkyl chain → less soluble.

Very weak acids ($pKa \approx 16-18$).
Can be **protonated** or **deprotonated**.

## Protonation/deprotonation

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-protonation-deprotonation.png]]

> $\ce{H2O}$ is a good leaving group and might leave in some reaction mechanisms.

> Any strong nucleophile can deprotonate alcohols, not only $\ce{OH-}$.

## Synthesis from alkenes

#### Acid-catalyzed hydration

**Reagents:**
- $\ce{H2O}$ (solvent)

**Requirements:**
- Acid catalyst ($\ce{H+}$)

**Product:** **racemic mixture**

Follows **Markovnikov's rule**, because a carbocation is formed.

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-from-alkenes-hydration.png]]

#### Hydration w/ shift

**Reagents:**
- $\ce{H2O}$ (solvent)

**Requirements:**
- Acid catalyst ($\ce{H+}$)

**Product:** **racemic mixture**

[[#Acid-catalyzed hydration]], but since the carbocation is formed, it can rearrange to form a more stable one.

The proton still bonds according to **Markovnikov's rule**.

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-hydration-with-methide-shift.png]]

#### Oxymercuration-demercuration

**Reagents:**
- $\ce{Hg(OAc)2}$
- $\ce{NaBH4}$
- $\ce{H2O}$ (solvent)

**Requirements:**
- None

**Product:** alcohol (no rearrangement)

Follows **Markovnikov's rule**.
Assures there is **no rearrangement**.

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-oxymercuration-demercuration.png]]

#### Hydroboration

**Reagents:**
- $\ce{BH3}$
- $\ce{H2O2}$
- $\ce{OH-}$

**Requirements:**
- Preferred solvent - [THF](Cheat%20Sheet#Acronyms)

**Product:** **anti-Markovnikov**

Cis/syn addition - both $\ce{-H}$ and $\ce{-OH}$ attach on the same side of the molecule, but it's still a racemic mixture.
$\ce{B}$ bonds to a less substituted side because it is the least hindered side → **anti-Markovnikov addition**.

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-hydroboration.png]]

> All 3 $\ce{H}$ in $\ce{BH3}$ are replaced by the starting molecule.
> One $\ce{BH3}$ molecule "processes" 3 starting molecules at once.

## Synthesis by Redox

In organic compounds, oxidation is often the **addition of oxygen** atoms and reduction - **addition of hydrogen** atoms.

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-redox.png]]

#### Reduction of carbonyls

Reducing agents:
- $\ce{LiAlH4}$ - **strong** reducing agent, use on **carboxylic acids**. **Use aprotic solvent.**
- $\ce{NaBH4}$ - **mild** reducing agent; use on **carbonyls**. Any solvent.

> All reductions are followed by an **acidic workup**!

> Reduction releases hydrogen gas! Be cautious of gas evolution!

![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-from-carbonyls.png]]

> If after reduction a stereocenter is formed, the resulting solution is a **racemic mixture** of the product stereoisomers.

Alkyl halides can also be reduced to alkanes using $\ce{LiAlH4}$ in the same manner as alcohols can be reduced to alkanes.

---

**Mechanisms:**

The reactivity of the carbonyls can be attributed to the fact that the $\ce{C=O}$ bond is polar and the carbon partially positively charged and thus electrophilic.

Reduction mechanism:
![[_media/Alcohols/alcohols-carbonyl-reduction-mechanism.png]]

#### Oxidation

Oxidizing agents:
- $\ce{CrO3 / H2CrO4 / CrO3 + H2SO4}$ - **strong** oxidizing agents; all the same; alcohol → acid.
- $\ce{KMnO4}$ - **strong** oxidizing agent; alcohol → acid.
- $\ce{PCC}$ (pyridinium chlorochromate) - **mild** oxidizing agent; alcohol → carbonyl.

How far can oxidize alcohols:
- $1 \degree$: alcohol → aldehyde → carboxylic acid
- $2 \degree$: alcohol → ketone
- $3 \degree$: **does not oxidize**

## Reactions

#### SN2/E2

Since the oxygen in the $\ce{-OH}$ group has lone $e^-$-pairs, it can act as a nucleophile in [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2) & [E2](Elimination#E2) reactions.
**Alkoxides** (deprotonated alcohols) are strong nucleophiles.

Favour [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2): Small substrate + bulky alcohol + lower temperatures.
Favour [E2](Elimination#E2): Bulky substrate + small alcohol + higher temperatures.

#### Williamsons ether synthesis

Ether synthesis via an [SN2](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN2) reaction.
