## Resonance structures

$e^-$ can move throughout the molecule's structure.
This stabilizes the structure, especially when an additional charge is present.

Rules for drawing resonance structures:
1. The real structure is the weighed average of the resonance structures.
2. **Only** $e^-$ move through the structure. All the atoms stay where they were.
3. **No hypervalent 2nd row elements!**
4. All structures must have the same \# of unpaired $e^-$.
5. All atoms participating in resonance must have parallel $p$ orbitals. They should be planar.
6. The energy of the real system is lower than the energy of any single resonance structures on their own. The real superimposed structure is more stable.
7. If the resonance structures are equivalent, they contribute to the real structure to the same extent. See $\ce{CO3^{2-}}$
8. The more stable the resonance structure is, the more it contributes;
	1. More covalent bonds → more stable (even w/ charge).
	2. Charges more separated → less stable.
	3. Negative charge on a more $e^-$-neg. atom → more stable.

## Pi systems

The $\pi$-system of **ethene**:

**HOMO** - Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital.
**LUMO** - Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital.

In ethene, HOMO is the $\pi$ bonding orbital (ethene has a $\pi$ bond), and LUMO is the $\pi^*$ anti-bonding orbital.

MO Theory is crucial for understanding conjugation.

## Conjugation

Conjugation happens when there is at least carbon atom w/ a $p$ orbital next to a $\pi$ bond.
In practice, this means alternating single-multiple bonds.

Example: **butadiene**

Besides the double bonds themselves, the carbons 2 & 3 also have the overlap in their $p$ orbitals, allowing for additional $e^-$ sharing and thus resonance.

> Conjugation only happens, if all the atoms involved are in the **same plane**.
> The entire system **must be planar**.

The single bond in butadiene are also shorter:
$\ce{C=C} \text{ (no change)}: 1.34 \space \text{Å}$
$\ce{C-C} \text{ (butadiene)}: 1.47  \space \text{Å}$
$\ce{C-C} \text{ (normally)} \space\space : 1.54  \space \text{Å}$

## In reactions

#### Rearrangement

Since conjugated systems can form resonance structures, they will sometimes rearrange to become more stable as reaction intermediates.

The proportions of the formed products depend on the temperature:
- Low temperature → kinetic product (formed faster, no rearrangement).
- High temperature → thermodynamic product (more stable, rearrangement).

## Diels-Alder reaction

**Pericyclic reaction** - concerted reaction, where there are more rings in the transition state than in the reactants.
