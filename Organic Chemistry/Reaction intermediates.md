3 common reaction mechanisms:
1. Bonds are broken **heterolytically**. $e^-$ stay on one of the fragments.
	![[_media/Reaction intermediates/heterolytic-bond-breakage.png]]
2. Bonds are broken **homolytically**. $e^-$ are distributed evenly, **radicals** are formed.
	![[_media/Reaction intermediates/homolytic-bond-breakage.png]]
3. All bonds are broken and formed in one step, no intermediates formed.

Very electronegative atoms (e.g. halogens) are good at stabilizing negative charge.
Good leaving groups.


Most common intermediates:
1. [[#Carbocations]] - $\ce{R+}$
2. [[#Radicals]] - $\ce{R.}$
3. [[#Carbanions]] - $\ce{R:^-}$

Intermediates are very reactive.

## Carbocations
$\ce{R+}$

$e^-$-poor intermediates.
$sp^2$ hybridized, w/ an empty $2p$ orbital.

> If the part of the molecule that has charge cannot easily become $sp^2$ hybridized, the reaction rate slows greatly

More substituted → much more stable.
$\ce{Me3C+ > Me2CH+ > MeCH2+ > CH3+}$

Sometimes stabilized by resonance by distributing charge across multiple carbon atoms.

Benzyl carbocations are especially stable because of resonance across the whole ring.

## Radicals
$\ce{R.}$

$e^-$-poor intermediates.
Unpaired $e^-$.

More substituted → much more stable.
$\ce{Me3C. > Me2CH. > MeCH2. > CH3.}$

Can also be stabilized by resonance.

## Carbanions
$\ce{R:^-}$

$e^-$-rich intermediates.
Usually $sp^3$ hybridized, except for when they are stabilized by resonance, then $sp^2$.

The stability order is reversed because the substituted groups would add more $e^-$.\:
$\ce{CH3:^- > MeCH2:^- > Me2CH:^- > Me3C:^-}$
