**Protic solvent** - can form hydrogen bonds w/ the solute. ($\ce{H2O, EtOH}$)
**Aprotic solvent** - cannot form hydrogen bonds w/ the solute. ($\ce{DMSO, CHCl3}$)

The nature of the solvent influences the chemical reactions.

Since in an [SN1](Nucleophilic%20substitution#SN1) reaction a carbocation (positively charged) is formed, this type of reaction is more prevalent in protic solvents, since hydrogen bonds are closer in terms of strength to ionic bonds than Keesom forces.
