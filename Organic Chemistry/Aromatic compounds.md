==NOTE: merge w/ Conjugated systems

Resonance stabilization makes benzene very stable.
All 6 bonds in benzene are **equal in length** - all 6 bonds are equal
$e^-$ are **equally spread** among the 6 carbon atoms.

Represented vs real structure:
```smiles
C1=CC=CC=C1
c1ccccc1
```

> It's better to represent benzene rings w/ double bonds because that way it is easier to count the \# of bonds.
> The aromatic bonds of benzene count as 2 bonds!



**Hückel's rule:**
Stable conjugated cyclic systems have $(4n+2) \space e^-$.
Cyclobutadiene - 4e - no
cyclohexatriene (benzene) - 6 e - yes
cyclooctotetraene - 10 e - yes

==something something oxidation/reduction...

## Aromaticity

Criteria:
- **Cyclic system**
- **Planar molecule (sp2)** - to make conjugation possible; one p orbital is empty, participating in the aromatic system.
- **Conjugation** - for resonance & stability.
- **Hückels rule** - for stability.


==cyclopentadiene, carbocation, carbanion more stable cuz huckels rule, hydrogens acidic


Heteroaromatics

some of the atoms in the cycle is not carbon

pyridine, fural, pyrrole


! consider if e are truly a free e pair or they contribute to aromaticity
