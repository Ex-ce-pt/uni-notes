Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon-based compounds.
Carbon is able to bind to other atoms & form long chains.

Organic chemistry primarily deals with covalent bonds.

## Hybridization

Covered by VBT (Valence Bond theory).

| Compound | Hybridization of carbon | Angles between the bonds |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Methane  | $sp^3$                  | $109.5 \degree$          |
| Ethene   | $sp^2$                  | $120 \degree$            |
| Ethyne   | $sp$                    | $180 \degree$            |

Strength and length of bonds are not proportional to the order of the bond.

#### Conjugation in pi-systems

```smiles
C=CC=C
```

In alternating double bonds.
The bond becomes delocalized, the strength of every bond is in between of the one of a single and double bond.

If there are single bonds in between, doesn't happen any more because the system is not planar any more.

```smiles
C=CCC=C
```
#### Acidity

Hybridization affects acidity.
Hydrocarbons are extremely weak acids, but multiple bonds make them better.

| Hydrocarbon | Hybridization | pKa  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---- |
| $\ce{C2H6}$ | $sp_3$        | $56$ |
| $\ce{C2H4}$ | $sp_2$        | $36$ |
| $\ce{C2H2}$ | $sp$          | $25$ |
