Molecules are 3-dimensioanal.
**Conformation** - spatial arrangement of a molecule that can be achieved by rotation around a single bond.

Different conformations have different energies.

**Staggered conformation** - the most stable conformation; hydrogens of bonded carbons are far from each other as possible.

**Eclipsed conformation** - the least stable conformation; hydrogens of bonded carbons directly opposite to each other.

**Gauche** - staggered conformation that is not the lowest possible for the molecule.

**Anti** - staggered conformation when the 2 largest substituents are opposite to each other.

## Locked structures

In locked structures where there is no free rotation (e.g. cyclohexane), conformation becomes particularly important.

**Chair conformation** - staggered conformation on all of the bonds of a locked structure; zig-zag.

**Boat conformation** - some carbons planar, some sticking up in the same direction.

axial bond
equatorial bond

ring flip → equatorial become axial and vice versa but pointing up or down doesn't change


substituents

if a substituent is axial and interaction with another one, it can do a ring flip and become equatorial.

equatorial position is lower in energy than axial

less electron-rich group is more favorable to have in an equatorial position

cis- and trans-isomers are applicable to conformations.
2 isomers of 1,2-dimethyl-cyclohexane:
==sdf

in cis 1:1
in trans to the left

cis if both pointing up/down
trans if pointing in opposite directions
>equitorial and axial doesn't matter here

smaller cycles → ring strain (suboptimal angles)

cyclopropane and cyclobutane are not stable, cyclopentane and further are stable

## Chirality

4 different groups bonded to a carbon atom.

==TODO: copy from Biological Chemistry

enantiomers have the same physical properties.
enantiomers polarize light in different directions - optically active.

diastereoisomers

diastereomers have slightly different physical properties

Racemic mixture - mixture of equal amounts of R and S enantiomers.

meso compounds - not optically active, have an inner symmetry plane.
