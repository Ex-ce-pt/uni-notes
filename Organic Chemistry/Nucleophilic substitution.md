Need a good **leaving group** to stabilize the negative charge.
Need an $e^-$-rich atom to donate an $e^-$-pair and form a bond - **nucleophile**.

Both reactions depend on the leaving group: the reaction happens, if the reactant (nucleophile) is a stronger nucleophile than the leaving group.

## Sn1

Happens in multiple steps:
1. Carbocation formed.
2. Nucleophile bonded - its group is positively charged.
3. A group leaves the nucleophile group relieving it of the positive charge.

**Products in stereochemistry**: **racemic mixture** of the stereoisomers.

Usually between bulky alkylhalides (e.g. tertiary carbocations) & weak nucleophiles.

Stable cation → higher rate.

> Since the formation of a carbocation is needed, the reaction cannot happen, if the cation cannot form.

## Sn2

Happens in a single step:
- The leaving group takes the $e^-$ from the bond & leaves; the nucleophile bonds to the carbon.

Usually w/ strong nucleophiles: strong bases, conjugate bases of weak acids, etc.

**Products in stereochemistry**: the absolute configuration is inversed: 
- *R* → *S*
- *S* → *R*

The nucleophile must come from the side opposite to the side the leaving group leaves from.
The mechanism of the reaction can be shown with a transition state:

Stable carbocation → slower rate.

>In tertiary carbocation it's hard for the nucleophile to access the carbon, since it has to approach from the opposite direction.

Nucleophiles are more reactive when they are... (generally, less stable):
1. Negatively charged: $\ce{OH-} > \ce{H2O}; \ce{RO-} > \ce{ROH}$
2. More basic: $\ce{RO-} > \ce{OH-} > \ce{RCO2-} > \ce{ROH} > \ce{H2O}$
3. In the same row of the periodic table, more electronegative: $\ce{R3C-} > \ce{R2N-} > \ce{RO-} > \ce{F-}$
4. In the same group, more downwards: $\ce{I-} > \ce{Br-} > \ce{Cl-} > \ce{F-} ; \ce{RS-} > \ce{RO-}$

==NOTE: how is I- a better nucleophile than Cl-?

**Solvolysis** - a reactant reacting with a solvent.

==TODO: find an example
