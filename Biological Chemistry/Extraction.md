A separation technique/purification to obtain a wanted compound in the right phase.
Different solvents are used to dissolve different compounds in a mixture, then the solvents separate themselves into layers.

Instrument used: **Separatory Funnel**.

> Polar compounds dissolve in water, non-polar in organic solvents.

If the density of the organic layer:
- < water's → it's on top
- > water's → it's at the bottom

> May add a drop of water to test the density.

## Acid-base extraction

Use acids or bases to make the compounds polar or non-polar. Ionic compounds are **polar** (dissolve in water).

> It depends on the compounds, if adding acid/base will make them polar or non-polar.
> 1. case → non-polar to polar
> 2. case → polar to non-polar
