**Chemical reaction** - process by which one chemicals are turned into others.
**Reactant** - a chemical the chemical reaction operates on.
**Product** - a chemical that's formed in the process of a chemical reaction.
**Reagent** - a chemical available at the lab.

## Skeletal reaction

Shows the *qualitative* (what's happening) summary of the chemical reaction.

$\ce{\text{reactants} -> \text{products}}$
$\ce{Na + H2O -> NaOH + H2}$

## Chemical Equation

Balanced equation.
Both *qualitative* (what's happening) and *quantitative* (how much stuff is involved).
$\ce{2 Na + 2 H2O -> 2 NaOH + H2}$

**Stoichiometric coefficient** - coefficient multiplying the whole molecule/formula unit in an equation.

**State symbol** - shows the state of the preceding reactant:
- **(s)** - solid
- **(l)** - liquid
- **(g)** - gas
- **(aq)** - aqueous solution

$\ce{2 Na (s) + 2 H2O (l) -> 2 NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$

#### Conditions

Some reactions require special conditions to take place.

1. High temp. ($\Delta$):
	$\ce{CaCO3 (s) ->[\Delta] CaO (s) + CO2 (g)}$
2. Catalyst:
	$\ce{2 SO2 (g) + O2 (g) ->[V2O5] 2 SO3 (g)}$

## Ionic & Net Ionic Equations

**Complete ionic equation (ionic equation)** - shows all the ions in the solution reacting.

$\ce{Ag+ (aq) + NO3- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + Cl (aq) -> AgCl (s) + Na+ (aq) + NO3- (aq)}$

**Spectator ions** - ions that are in the solution but don't react themselves; they appear on both sides of the equation, here $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{NO3-}$.
Spectator ions can be cancelled out.

**Net ionic equation** - shows only the ions that are actually reacting together.

$\ce{Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) -> AgCl (s)}$
