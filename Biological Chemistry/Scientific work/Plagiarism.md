**Plagiarism** - a serious form of cheating involving taking someone's text, ideas, images etc. and presenting it as your own work.

Might be intentional or unintentional.

>Taking info from your own previously submitted assignment without citing is also plagiarism!

Giving credit to the original creator is an essential part of **academic integrity**.

## Types of plagiarism
### Unintentional plagiarism

Without intent, out of ignorance or carelessness.
Is as serious as intentional plagiarism.

### Patchwork plagiarism

Taking little fragments of texts and ideas from here and there.
**Changing the wording a little does not help!**
Hard to identify.

### Plagiarism through paraphrasing

If paraphrasing completely → cite source
If quoting → use quotation marks, cite source

If the paraphrased version is too similar, it might count as quoting.

### Text recycling (self-plagiarism)

Using own work again without citing.

### Direct plagiarism (copy-paste)

Deliberate, unethical form of theft.
- copy-pasted text or media,
- text written by another person
- AI

### Common knowledge

Common knowledge doesn't have to be cited, but the line may be difficult to draw.
Always cite, if unsure.

### AI

A new phenomenon, discussions still ongoing.
AI may be misleading and/or not clear in its sources.
AI company may own the rights to the generated content.

### Citing

Read → Select important parts → Rewrite in own words → Insert a reference → Repeat

Stick to one reference style when writing a text.

Styles:

| In text                   | In reference lists                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
