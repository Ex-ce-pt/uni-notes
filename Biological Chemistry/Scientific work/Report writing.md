#Science 

Importance - communication of the research results to the public in a written form.

Should be detailed, clear, on-point.
> All the reported work should be possible for the reader to reproduce!

Use provided templates - different organizations have different templates.

Justify choices of the methods.

### Title

Method-reflecting: *"Microscopy-based analysis of biofilm formation in E.coli"*
Aim-reflecting: *"Investigating biofilm formation in E. coli under stress conditions"*
Result-reflecting: *"Nutrient limitation enhances biofilm formation in E. coli"*
Combination: *"Microscopy reveals nutrient-dependent biofilm formation in E. coli"*

Choosing:
1. Focus of report
2. Result strength:
	- preliminary/uncertain → aim/method
	- strong → result/combination
3. Audience
	- teachers → aim/combination
	- scientists/journals → clickbaity

### Abstract

Short summary: 150-250 words.
Placed at the beginning, written last.
SEO applies.

1. Why was the study conducted?
2. How was the study done?
3. What were the methods used?
4. What were the results?
5. What does it mean?

OCAR: Opening → Challenge → Action → Resolution

### Table of Contents

- Headings & page numbers
- Commonly done through the editing program

### Introduction

- Start broad
- Introduce concepts
- Specify relevance
- Define aim/hypothesis
- Very short summary of methods
- Overview of relevant literature

### Materials & Methods

- Detailed description of methods, strategies, settings of the machines, statistics theory used etc.
- Includes the actual work conducted
- Should be reproduceable

### Results

- Concise & clear
- Only data, no discussion
- Objectivity - try to disprove the hypothesis, not prove it

Figures must have numbering, heading, legend, notes.
Only relevant figures.

### Discussion

- Adds meaning to the results
- Explain patterns and unexpected findings
- Consider uncertainty

### Conclusion

- Wraps up the study in 2-3 sentences
- Connects back to the aim
- No new data

### Acknowledgements

Thanking supporters, coworkers, lab assistants, teachers, investors.
**Not co-authors**

### Reference List

Use a single style
A reference should be visible in the text with a link

Author - year - title - book - volume - pages

### Documentation

- [[Lab Notebook]]
- Should be detailed and accurate
- To be able to reproduce experiments as closely as possible
- Might be important when dealing with patents
