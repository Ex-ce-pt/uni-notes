	- eye wash stations,
	- fire extinguishers,
	- fire blankets,
	- first aid kits
2. Do [[Risk Assessment]] & show to assistant
3. Plan steps, keep [[Lab Notebook]]

# General Safety

- Common Sense!
- Overestimate the danger
- Don't pour chemicals back
- Don't mix up the lids of the glassware
- To dilute, put **acid into water** (SIV rule - *syra i vatten*)
- Boil without splashes

# Chemical Waste

### Substances
**Flammable solvents** (Ex. benzene, toluene),
**Halogenated solvents** (Ex. [DCM](Cheat%20Sheet.md)) - rinse /w acetone, then into special container

**Aqueous waste** (Ex. diluted acids or bases) - rinse /w water, then sink

**Solid waste** - ***Riskavfall*** OR dissolve in acetone and into **Flammable**

### Broken Dishes
- Contaminated → ***Riskavfall***
- Clean → ***Glasavfall***
