Most frequent evidence.

Information:
1. [Species](#Anatomy) - Human or animal
2. Nature - straight/curvy, color, etc.
3. Origin on the body
4. [Forcibly pulled out or naturally shed](#Detachment)
5. Presence of chemicals - hair absorbs metabolized drugs
6. If dyed
7. [DNA](#DNA) (if the root is preserved)

## Anatomy

Growth speed: ~1.3 cm/month

**Cuticle** - outermost layer, protects the hair, helps identifying the species.
**Cortex** - gives hair color, strength, and texture, contains keratin and color pigments.
**Medulla** - innermost layer, thickness depends on the species.

## Detachment

Naturally shed hair's root is intact.
Forcibly removed hair's root is visibly damaged or there is some additional tissue present.

Forcibly removed hair suggests confrontation.

## DNA

Root contains the human's/animal's DNA.
The hair itself can only provide mitochondrial DNA.
Mitochondrial DNA is inherited form the mother only.
