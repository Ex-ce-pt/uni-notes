## DNA in forensics

Sources of DNA at crime scenes:

Human genome has ~3.2 billion nucleotides.
99.8% of the sequence is identical, 0.2% *could* be different.

How genes could be different:
- Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP): a single nucleotide is **different**.
- Insertions: one or many nucleotides are **added** to the sequence in a specific position.
- Deletions: one or many nucleotides are **omitted** in a specific position.
- **Short Tandem Repeats** (STRs, microsatellites) - a group of 2-6 nucleotides are consecutively repeated, the group and \# of repeats varies greatly from person to person and between the chromosomes of a single person.
- **Variable Number Tandem Repeats** (VNTRs, minisatelite) - same as STRs, but 10-100 nucleotides repeat.

Makes forensics easier:
- Diversity of population - more different STR alleles per loci.
- Small PCR product - more trustworthy, blood is often not intact.
- Testing different STR loci on different chromosomes - less chance that the loci are not inherited together.

**CODIS** (Combined DNA index system) - a system of naming and referencing to different STR loci.
Example: D1S80 locus is the one we were using in the lab.

#### PCR

Polymerase Chain Reaction.
Used to duplicate a discrete section of DNA.

**Primers** - pre-made little strands of DNA that are located right before and after the target section of DNA to be duplicated.
**Taq** (*Thermus aquaticus*) - bacterium, whose DNA Polymerase works well at higher temperatures.

1. Denaturation (94°C, 30s) - DNA strands come apart.
2. Annealing of primers (55°C, 30s) - primers connect to the strands at their positions.
3. Extension (72°C, 30s) - Taq DNA Polymerase extends the strands /w free nucleotides from the solution, recreating the target section, as well as the DNA after it.
4. Repeat process 30-35 times.

> $\ce{MgCl2}$ is a cofactor to Taq DNA Polymerase - it acts as a catalyst.
> dNTPs - mixture of nucleotides used to extend the DNA strand.

#### Analysis

The PCR product is analyzed with different methods.
Capillary electrophoresis - used in forensics labs, high resolution, plots a spectrum of DNA strand sizes.
Agarose gel electrophoresis - DNA strands move through the gel under electric current.

> DNA is negatively charged!
