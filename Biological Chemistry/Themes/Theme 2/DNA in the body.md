**RNA** (ribonucleic acid) - encodes genetic information in bacteria, and often has functionality.
**mRNA** (messenger RNA) - Takes genetic information from DNA to ribosome.
**DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid) - contains the genetic instructions.
**Codon** - set of 3 nucleotides, encodes a single protein.
**Nucleobase** - organic base, unit of information in RNA and DNA, has a letter associated with it.
**Nucleotide** - phosphate ($\ce{-PO4}$) + sugar +nucleobase.

## DNA

DNA is made of nucleotides.

#### Sugars

Sugars (pentose sugars):
![[ribose, deoxyribose.png]]
n' are the carbon numbering.
The difference is the $\ce{OH}$ group.

#### Nucleobases

- C - Cytosine
- G - Guanine
- T - Thymine
- A - Adenine
- U - Uracil

Nucleobases complement each other: C-G, A-T, A-U
A and G are **purines** - double ring.
T, C, and U are **pyrimidines** - single ring.

Nucleobases connect with hydrogen bonds.

> In RNA, U instead of T.

## Phosphodiester bond

$\ce{C-PO4-C}$
Bond between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar (3') of another.
Keeps the DNA stable.

## Double helix

DNA is shaped like a double helix.
It has 2 "grooves" - trails in the helix.

![[DNA double helix.png]]

Major Groove:
- From the spacing of phosphate groups in the strands.
- Larger.
- More accessible for enzymes and proteins.

Minor Groove:
- Phosphate-sugar backbones are closer to the strands.
- Narrower.
- Less accessible, but still important in some specific interactions.

> When written in a string, DNA is generally from 5' to 3'.

## DNA location

Prokaryotic cells - cytoplasm, commonly single chromosome.
Eukaryotic cells - nucleus, chromosomes (46 for humans).

## DNA Replication

Process by which one DNA molecule turns into 2.

1. Replication starts in one direction and goes continuously. This is the **leading strand**. On the old strand, the direction is 3' → 5', on the new stand being added, 5' → 3'.
2. DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleobases to the old DNA strand.
3. At the same time, another DNA polymerase molecule works in the opposite direction, adding nucleobases to the 2nd strand. Since the area before the starting point of replication is not unzipped, polymerase continuously jumps further and works its way back again and again, forming Okazaki fragments. This is the **lagging strand**.

## Central dogma

Core idea of microbiology of how the cell works: DNA → RNA → Protein.

1. [DNA Replication](#DNA%20Replication) - DNA copies itself.
2. Transcription - RNA polymerase stores the information from the DNA in an mRNA molecule.
3. Translation - ribosome of the cell creates a protein based on the mRNA instructions.

Genetic code is divided into **codons** (kind of like bytes).
Every codon encodes a specific aminoacid to use in the protein.
There are separate codons for start and end aminoacids.
