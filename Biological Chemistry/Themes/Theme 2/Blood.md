Adult: 4-6 l of blood.

## Contents

- Cells:
	- Red blood cells (erythrocytes) - contains hemoglobin, carry oxygen.
	- White blood cells (leukocytes) - immune system cells, fight infections.
	- Platelets (thrombocytes) - clump, form blood clot.
- Plasma - liquid part of blood, carries dissolved $\ce{CO2}$:
	- Proteins, salts, antibodies, etc.

## At crime scene

Blood is difficult to find at the crime scene.
It blends in with the surroundings and there's little of it.

Can be detected with luminol.
Luminol glows when iron in hemoglobin catalyzes a reaction.
Very sensitive, detects as little as 1 ppm of blood.
Detects blood traces on cleaned surfaces.
Does not prevent further analysis of blood.

Luminol + base ($\ce{NaOH}$) + oxidizing agent ($\ce{H2O2}$) → glow!

## Blood typing

**Antigen** - structure on the surface of the cell to bind to.
**Antibody** - protein that binds to antigens of cells to neutralize them.

ABO system is used.

Human blood has 3 antigen/antibody types: **A**, **B**, and **D** (Rhesus).
Letter A → antigen A is present.
Letter B → antigen B is present.
Letter O → neither are present.
+/- → presence of antigen D.

Plasma has antibodies for **all the antigens** that are not present in the blood.

| Blood Type | Antigen | Antibody       |     | Rhesus | Antibody |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | --- | ------ | -------- |
| A          | A       | Anti-B         |     | +      | -        |
| B          | B       | Anti-A         |     | -      | Anti-D   |
| AB         | A, B    | -              |     |        |          |
| O          | -       | Anti-A, Anti-B |     |        |          |

Antibodies bind to the antigens on the erythrocytes and clod the blood → immune response, death.

**Agglutination** - liquid clumping together.
**Hemagglutination** - agglutination of blood because of the antibodies targeting erythrocytes.

That gives the blood transfusion graph:

| Erythrocytes                            | Plasma                            |

> By the logic of blood transfusion, a **whole blood transfusion** can only happen between people with exactly the same blood type.
