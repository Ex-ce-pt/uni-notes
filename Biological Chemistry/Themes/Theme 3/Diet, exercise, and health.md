#Theme3

**Health** - a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

Top 5 threads to global health (WHO):
1. Air pollution & climate change
2. **Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) (aka chronic diseases)** - cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory diseases, diabetes
3. Global influenza pandemic
4. Fragile and vulnerable settings
5. Antimicrobial resistance

#### Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study

Study since 1980s in Västebotten (had the biggest cardiovascular mortality).
More than 143 000 participants.
People of ages 40, 50, 60 invited to specialized councelling.
'Green keyhole' food marking - healthiness, environmental factor etc.

#### The EAT-Lancet Commission

Taking into account all different factors, how we should eat:
![[EAT-Lancet Commission food plate.png]]

Why should consider changing eating habits:
- Reduce NDCs/chronic disease - cardiometabolic, cancer, **colon cancer**.
- Stay within planetary boundaries - sustainable food production.
- Ensure dietary equity - distribute food more fairly.

Consumption of red meat correlates to increased risk of colon cancer.

#### Physical activity

**Physical activity** - bodily movement achieved by contraction of skeletal muscles that increases energy expenditure above resting levels.

Energy Expenditure = Internal heat + External Work

Effect:
- Blood flow to brain
- Liver glucose output increases
- Skin sweat rate increases
- Oxygen transport speeds up
- Heart rate quickens
- Skeletal muscles consume resources and signal to other parts of the body

Signaling:
- Autocrine signaling (self-signaling)
	Cell secretes signaling molecules that bind to receptors on its own surface.
- Paracrine signaling (adjacent-signaling)
	Cells release signaling molecules that affect nearby target cells.
- Endocrine signaling (distant signaling)
	Signaling molecules - hormones - are produced by specialized cells - endocrine glands - and transported via blood.

Body always balances the use of different fuels, and training also trains the body to switch between fuels more rapidly.

**Metabolic flexibility** - ability of the body to switch between different fuels ("substrate utilization").

Way to predict [diabetes](#Diabetes) - poor metabolic flexibility.
One solution - exercise.

#### Exercise

**Physical exercise** - physical activity for improving, maintaining, or expressing a particular type of physical fitness.

- Cardio-respiratory capacity
- Muscular strength
- Body composition
- Muscular endurance
- Flexibility
- Muscular power
- Coordination/motor control

> 150-300 min/week (moderate) or 75-100 min/week (vigorous) of workout prevents NCDs.

Reduced activity decreases activity of enzymes that break down fat.

Exercise remodels skeletal muscle lipids and improves glucose uptake without to weight loss.
![[endurance trained vs obese.png]]

#### Athlete's paradox

Both endurance athletes and obese diabetes patients have fat stored in the muscles.
But athletes have different types of fat, more mitochondria to use that fat during exercise and are more sensitive to insulin, which makes them healthier.
Diabetes patients have less mitochondria and are less sensitive to insulin.

#### Measurements

**Metabolic rate** - how quickly fuels are broken down.

**Metabolites** - intermediate or end product of metabolism, used to track specific processes.
**Metabolome** - all the metabolites in the cell/tissue in aggregate.
**Metabolomics** - study and analysis of metabolomes.
**Lipidomics** - metabolomics focused on lipids in particular.

> Lean mass - usually muscle mass

$BMI = \frac{weigh}{length^2}$

**Accelerometry** - using accelerometers to track person's movements throughout a period of time.

Metabolic flexibility is measured by analyzing breathed out air.
**RQ (respiratory quotient)** = Amount of CO2 breathed out / Amount of O2 breathed in

RQ = 0.7  - 100% fats
RQ = 0.85 - 50/50 carbs/fats
RQ = 1 - 100% carbs

> There are always some carbs burned, fats never reach 100%.

**Fitness level** - capacity to produce ATP at a particular intensity or duration.

$\ce{VO2max}$ - maximal oxygen uptake during intense exercise - maximal aerobic power.
Sedentary lifestyle - $15 \space \frac{ml}{kg \cdot min}$; Athletes - $80 \space \frac{ml}{kg \cdot min}$.

## Metabolism in cells

**Homeostasis** - tendency to maintain a stable, relatively constant internal environment.
Negative feedback loops counteract any changes.

> Body maintains homeostasis. If you were to chug a lot of sugar, your sugar content in blood would barely increase since the body would immediately try to get rid of everything unnecessary.

**Catabolism** - decomposing large energy-rich molecules into smaller constituents/ATP.
**Anabolism** - building complex molecules out of simpler ones and energy.

Metabolism = Catabolism + Anabolism

ATP needed for:
- Mechanical work - muscle movement.
- Chemical work/biosynthesis - synthesizing molecules in cells.
- Maintaining homeostasis - active transportation of molecules into and out of cells.

ATP - adenosine triphosphate, stores energy, can interact with most enzymes.
$\ce{ATP + H2O \leftrightharpoons ADP + P_i + H+ + Energy}$
$\ce{ADP + H2O \leftrightharpoons AMP + P_i + H+ + Energy}$

Redox reactions are prevalent in the body for energy transportation.
Oxidation - generates energy.
Reduction - preserves energy.
Redox reactions typically happen by adding/removing hydrogens.

Hydrogen carriers shuffle hydrogens around the body.
Dehydrogenase - hydrogen carrier that works with a molecule NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide):
![[NAD.png]]
FAD - flavin adenine dinucleotide, another hydrogen carrier ($\ce{FAD+ \leftrightharpoons FADH2}$)

#### Mitochondria

> Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!

Mitochondrion (sing.) - mitochondria (pl.)

More [exercise](#Exercise) → more mitochondria (the mitochondria themselves don't become more efficient).

Mitochondria is where [[#TCA cycle]] and [[#Electron transport chain]] happen.

Input: monosaccharides, fatty acids, amino acids, $\ce{O2}$.
Output: $\ce{ATP}$, $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{CO2}$.

---
Speed of ATP generation can be quickly adjusted by engaging corresponding metabolic systems.

Metabolic systems (pathways):
1. [[#Glycolysis]], [[#Oxidation of fats]], [[#Oxidation of amino acids]]
2. [[#TCA cycle]]
3. [[#Electron transport chain]]
4. [[#Fat storage in Adipocytes]]

#### Glycolysis

Happens in **cytosol** (outside of mitochondria).
**Anaerobic** process.

![[glycolysis.png]]

If there's enough oxygen (aerobic exercise), the pyruvate is then turned into **Acetyl-CoA**, which is passed on to the [[#TCA cycle]].
If there's not enough oxygen (anaerobic exercise), the pyruvate turns into lactate (uses up $\ce{NADH}$).
Lactate shifts the body's pH and causes muscle pain.
Athletes are more tolerant to lactate.

> During anaerobic exercise, **lactate** is generated, not **lactic acid**!

#### Oxidation of fats

Triglycerides turn into fatty acids and then into **Acetyl-CoA**, which is passed on to the [[#TCA cycle]].
Glucose is needed to fully oxidize fats (at the TCA cycle stage).
If there's not enough glucose, **ketone bodies** are created instead and sent as fuel to the brain.

#### Oxidation of amino acids

Amino acids are needed elsewhere, preferably they don't oxidize much.
Where they enter the cycle depends on the size of the amino acid.

#### TCA cycle

Tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs cycle, etc.).
Happens in the **matrix of mitochondria**.
**Aerobic** process.
Where the majority of $\ce{CO2}$ is generated.
Generates more ATP from Acetyl-CoA and provides an electron and a hydrogen for the electron transport chain.

#### Electron Transport Chain

Happens in the inner membrane of mitochondria.
**Aerobic** process.
Where the majority of $\ce{H2O}$ is created.
Hydrogen used up: $\ce{NADH -> NAD+ + H+}$.

An electron goes along the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and electrically pulls hydrogens out into the area in between the inner and outer membranes. The hydrogen is charged and wants to bind to something. It's forced to take a long route through the ATP Synthase. There, APT Synthase uses the energy of the moving hydrogen to generate a new ATP molecule from ADP.

![[electron transport chain.png]]

#### Fat storage in Adipocytes

**Adipocyte** - lipid storage cell.
Excess Acetyl-CoA after glycolysis is used to create fats and store them in adipocytes.
Process regulated by [[#Hormones]].

---
#### Hormones

Pancreas is an organ located underneath the stomach.
$\alpha$-cells produce glucagon. $\beta$-cells produce insulin. These hormones act opposite to each other.

Insulin:
- Lets glucose from the blood into cells.
- Promotes glucose conversion into fat for storage.
- Secreted in fed state.

Glucagon:
- Keeps glucose in the blood.
- Inhibits fat synthesis.
- Promotes usage of stored fat for ATP generation.
- Secreted in fasted state.

Pancreas produces necessary hormones almost instantly when the situation changes.

## Diabetes

Chronic disease.
You don't die of diabetes, you die of its complications.
Food insecurity drives diabetes - people eat as much as they possibly can when they get a hold of food.

Healthy - blood has glucose and insulin, cells have insulin receptors that let glucose in.
Type I diabetes (genetic, virus) - no insulin in blood, glucose doesn't get in.
Type II diabetes (lifestyle, genetic) - insulin receptor on the cell is desensitized and doesn't let glucose in.

![[diabetes types.png]]

95% of diabetes patients have type II.
Cells susceptible to insulin - need more insulin to let glucose in.
All people are more affected in different tissues - no way to test in which specifically.

Risk groups (statistically):
- Older people
- Obese people
- Men
- Women in menopause
- People with family history of diabetes

Complications:
- Brain stroke
- Cardiovascular disease
- Cancer
- Kidney, dental, eye, neurological problems, etc.

> Diabetes is a lipid disease, not sugar disease!

**Lipotoxicity (lipid spill-over effect)** - diabetes patients start storing lipids in affected organs instead of adipocytes.

> Not all stored fat is bad, but specific fat in specific areas (inside organs, tissues, muscles).

#### Treatment

Diabetes remission (not complete treatment!) - only works for type II:
- Reducing weigh rapidly.
- Body anxiously uses up stored lipids to stay alive.
- Seemingly healthy body achieved.
- The moment you gain weigh, you're back.
If had diabetes for too long - remission not effective, $\beta$-cells need to be able to produce some insulin on their own.
