Bacterium (sg.) - bacteria (pl.)

Up to 50% of cells in humans - bacteria.
1-2 kg of bacteria in the gut of adult human.

Divide every 20 min on average (E. coli) -  exponential growth!

Can spread by themselves /w propellers, forming a circular colony.

The majority of bacteria are helpful in:
- metabolism
- vitamin production

Shapes of bacteria (in pl.):
- spherical - cocci
- cylindrical - bacilli
- chains - streptococci
- clusters - staphylococci

Antibiotics kill **all** bacteria, including the good ones.

## Gram's test

Staining procedure, used to categorize bacteria.

Procedure:
1. Stain cells purple - all cells are purple.
2. Wash /w organic solvent - negatives are easily washed, positives are not washed and stay purple.
3. Stain the cells red - negatives are red, positives remain purple.

| Gram's test          | Positive | Negative |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Color after test** | purple   | red      |
| **Outer membrane**   | no       | yes      |
| **Peptidoglycan**    | thicker  | thinner  |

## Drug types

**Bacteriostatic** - slows down the growth of bacteria.
**Bactericidal** - kills the bacteria.

Example of antibacterial agents:
Sulfonamides: $\ce{-S(=O)2NH -}$
```smiles
[R]S(=O)(=O)N[R]
```
Targets enzymes at specific stages of reactions.
Very efficient and targeted.
Means lower dosage is needed for effect - safer!

> Targets must **only** affect the bacteria, **not humans**!

Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics.

| Target                          | Resistance                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cell Wall                       | Efflux - pumps out foreign molecules.                                |
| Cell Membrane                   | Inactivating enzymes - deactivating the drug molecules.              |
| Protein Synthesis               | Immunity & bypass - multiple ways to produce needed compounds.       |
| Folate Synthesis                | Target modification - changing the inner workings of the cell.       |
| *DNA/RNA* - **affects humans!** | Resistance sharing - bacteria exchange plasmids /w resistance genes. |

Common targets are how bacteria develop resistance from antibiotics exploiting them (just a table, no correlation between the rows!).

Find new targets.

**Virulence factors** - factors that bacteria needs to cause disease. Might be abused instead of outright killing the bacteria.

## Drug Discovery

**Drug** - interacts /w biological system & produces biological response.

$TI$ - therapeutic index.
$TD_{50}$ - toxic dose of the drug for 50% of the test subjects.
$ED_{50}$ - drug produces biological response in 50% of the test subjects.
$TI_{\text{safety}} = \frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}}, \space TI_{\text{efficacy}} = \frac{ED_{50}}{TD_{50}}$

Drug targets somewhere in the body.
Molecules bind to molecules in the body (e.g. enzymes) via [interactions between molecules](Interactions%20between%20molecules).

Discovery might include:
- Improving existing pharmaceuticals
- Observing the biochemistry of the cell
- Using natural ligands
- Systematic screening of many targets and compounds
- Rational approach (computation, theoretical modeling of the desired compound)

Drug discovery roadmap:
1. Identify disease
2. Validate pharmaceutical target
3. Identify lead molecules
4. [Optimize](#Optimization) lead molecules
5. Preclinical trials (in vivo, patent, planning manufacturing)
6. [Clinical trials](#Clinical%20trials)
7. Approval for distribution

#### Optimization

$IC_{50}$ (inhibitory concentration) - how much drug is needed to inhibit 50% of a biological process (in vitro).

**Pharmacophore** - the most important part of the lead molecule; cannot be changed during optimization.
**Pharmacokinetics** - what the body does to the drug (ADME: absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion).
**Pharmacodynamics** - what drug does to the body (interaction, intensity, duration).

The molecule needs to be able to pass to the active site as well as be efficient.

#### Metabolism

Liver is very good at filtering out the foreign molecules.
Enzyme: Cytochrome P450 + its isoforms

**Xenobiotic** - chemical that's not normally found within the body; foreign molecule.

#### Clinical trials

Phase I - Healthy volunteers (tens)
Phase II - Small group of patients (hundreds)
Phase III - Larger group of patients (thousands)
Phase IV - Market
