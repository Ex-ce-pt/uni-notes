**Compound** - electrically neutral combination of different atoms.

**Organic compounds** - contain carbon & hydrogen.
**Inorganic compounds** - everything else + simple carbon compounds.
**Intermetallic compounds** - inorganic compounds of metals, $\ce{NiTi,FeCo, Ag3Sn}$.

**Molecule** - discrete group of atoms bonded together in a specific arrangement.
**Molecular compound** - compound that consists of neutral molecules.
**Ion** - charged atom/molecule.
**Cation** - positive ion, $\ce{Na+}$.
**Anion** - negative ion, $\ce{Cl-}$.
**Ionic compound** - compound that consists of ions in proportion to cancel each other.

> Generally: binary compounds of 2 nonmetals are molecular ($\ce{H2O}$), of metal and nonmetal - ionic ($\ce{NaCl}$).

## Formulae

**Chemical formula** - represents the composition of a compound.

1. Molecular formula - shows the number of elements.
	$\ce{H2O, C2H4O}$
2. Empirical formula - shows the ratios of elements.
	$\ce{CH2O} \space \text{for all} \space \ce{C6H12O6, C2H4O2, C3H6O3}$
3. Structural formula - shows the bonds between all atoms.
4. Line structure - shows the bonds between carbon atoms & different groups.
	```smiles
	O
	C=CO
	```
5. [[Lewis structures]]
6. Space-filling model - shows molecules as 3D collections of spheres.
7. Ball-and-stick model - shows molecules as 3D balls connected by lines.
8. Tube structure - shows molecules as connected 3D lines.
9. Density isosurface - shows how electrons are spread throughout the molecule.
10. Electrostatic potential (elpot) surface -  shows electric charge on the density isosurface.

$\text{Mass \% of element} = \frac{m_{elem}}{m_{sample}} \times 100\%$

## Ions

Elements on the left of the periodic table (metals) form cations.
Elements on the right (nonmetals) form anions.
For Groups 1, 2, 14-17, atoms are lost/gained until there's the same number of atoms as the nearest noble gas.

**Monoatomic ions** - consist of 1 atom ($\ce{Cl-}$).
**Diatomic ions** - consist of 2 atoms ($\ce{NH4+}$).
**Polyatomic ions** - consists of several atoms ($\ce{HCO3+}$).
**Oxoanions** - polyatomic anions that contain oxygen ($\ce{CO3^{2+}}$).

> Instead of "molecule", we say "formula unit" for ionic compounds!

Ionic compounds have orderly structure.

**Hydrate** - ionic compound /w water molecules in the crystal.
**Anhydrous compound** - hydrate without the water, original ionic compound.

$\ce{CuSO4*5H2O}$ - copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate ([[Nomenclature#Inorganic Chemistry#Ionic compounds]]).
