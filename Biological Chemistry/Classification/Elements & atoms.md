[Atom](#Nuclear%20model) - the smallest particle of an element.
**Element** - substance composed on only one kind of atom.
[Compound](Compounds.md) - electrically neutral combination of different atoms.
**Synthesis** - combining elements to form compounds.
**Isotopes** - atoms of the same element but /w different mass.
**Mass spectrometer** - a device that determines the mass of an atom.
## Nuclear model

**Atom**:
- **Nucleus** (nucleons) - positive charge & majority of mass
	- **Protons** ($p$)
	- **Neutrons** ($n$)
- **Electron shell** - negative charge
	- **Electrons** ($e^-$)

| Particle | Symbol | Charge, [e](Cheat%20Sheet.md#Constants) | Mass, kg                |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| electron | $e^-$  | -1                               | $9.109 \times 10^{-31}$ |
| proton   | $p$    | +1                               | $1.673 \times 10^{-27}$ |
| neutron  | $n$    | 0                                | $1.675 \times 10^{-27}$ |

$Z = \text{atomic number} = \text{\# of protons}$
$A = \text{mass number} = (\text{\# of protons}) + (\text{\# of neutrons})$

$\ce{^{22}_{10}Ne} \space \text{- neon-22}, \space Z = 10, \space A = 22$
Isotopes have essentially the same chemical & physical properties (apart from lighter elements).

| Isotope   | Symbol        | Z   | A   | Abundance, %    |
| --------- | ------------- | --- | --- | --------------- |
| hydrogen  | $\ce{^1H}$    | 1   | 1   | 99.985          |
| deuterium | $\ce{^2H/D}$  | 1   | 2   | 0.015           |
| tritium   | $\ce{^3H/T}$  | 1   | 3   | - (radioactive) |
| carbon-12 | $\ce{^{12}C}$ | 6   | 12  | 98.90           |
| carbon-13 | $\ce{^{13}C}$ | 6   | 13  | 1.10            |
| oxygen-16 | $\ce{^{16}O}$ | 8   | 16  | 99.76           |

## Periodic Table

![[periodic-table.webp]]

Vertical columns - groups, 1-18
Horizontal rows - periods

Taller columns - main groups, 1, 2, 13-18
Rectangular regions - s, p, d, f blocks

s-block - super-reactive metals
d-block - transition metals
f-block - inner transition metals (Period 6 - lanthanoids/lanthanides, Period 7 - actinoids/actinides)

Group 1: alkali metals - soft, lustrous, low melting point
Group 2: alkali earth metals - less reactive than Group 1
Group 17: halogens - have many different properties, form diatomic molecules
Group 18: noble gases - colorless, odorless gases, don't react much

Same group - similar properties.

**Metal** - conducts electricity, has luster, malleable, ductile.
**Nonmetal** - doesn't conduct electricity, no luster, not malleable nor ductile.
**Metalloid** - appearance of a metal, but properties depend on conditions.

> Luster - shine.
> Malleable - possible to hammer into thin sheets.
> Ductile - possible to stretch into wires.

## History

#### Ancient Greeks

First idea of an indivisible particle.

#### John Dalton
English schoolteacher & chemist.
1807 - First arguments for atoms based on the mass ratios in compounds.
Atomic hypothesis:
1. Same element → identical atom.
2. Different elements → different mass.
3. Compound - combination of different atoms.
4. In a chemical reaction, atoms interchange and aren't created nor destroyed.

#### Henry Moseley

British scientist.
First to determine atomic numbers by bombarding atoms /w electrons and studying x-rays emitted back.
