**Mixture** - a set of substances mingled with one another.
**Heterogeneous mixture** - one that has distinct visible regions of a single substance.
**Homogeneous mixture (solution)** - one that has no distinct regions of a single substance.

| Mixture                                           | Compound                                             |

> Forming a solution is a physical change, not a chemical one!

>solvent + solute → solution

Solvent normally determines the state of matter of the solution.

**Crystallization** - solute comes out of the solution slowly, large crystals form.
**Precipitation** - solute comes out of the solution rapidly, large crystals don't form; [[Precipitation Reaction]].

**Aqueous solution** - the solvent is water.
**Nonaqueous solution** - the solvent is not water.

## Concentration

**Molar concentration ("Molarity")** - amount of solute molecules/formula units per volume of solvent.

$c = \frac{n}{V}$

| Symbol | Unit  | Explanation                   |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| $c$    | $M$   | Molarity of the solution      |
| $n$    | $mol$ | Chemical amount of the solute |
| $V$    | $l$   | Volume of the solvent         |
[Unit](Cheat%20Sheet#Units): $[c] = \text{Chemical Amount} \times \text{Volume}^{-1} = \text{Chemical Amount} \times \text{Length}^{-3} = \text{Molar}$

#### Dilution

Adding more solvent to reduce the concentration of the solute.
A way of measuring a specific, very small amount of substance to work with.
Or to bring the **stock solution** (stored in the lab) to the concentration needed.

$c_{initial}V_{initial} = c_{final}V_{final} = n$

| Symbol        | Unit  | Explanation                      |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| $c_{inital}$  | $M$   | Molarity of the initial solution |
| $V_{initial}$ | $l$   | Volume of the initial solution   |
| $c_{final}$   | $M$   | Molarity of the final solution   |
| $V_{final}$   | $l$   | Volume of the final solution     |
| $n$           | $mol$ | Amount of chemical               |

## Electrolytes

**Soluble substance** - dissolves in a specified solvent significantly ($> 0.1 \space M$).
**Insoluble substance** - doesn't dissolve much ($< 0.1 \space M$).

**Electrolyte** - a substance that conducts electricity /w ions.
**Nonelectrolyte** - doesn't conduct electricity.

**Strong electrolyte** - mostly ions in the solution:
- strong acids - $\ce{HCl}$
- strong bases - $\ce{NaOH}$
- soluble ionic compounds - $\ce{NaCl}$
**Weak electrolyte** - mostly molecules in the solution.

**Electrolyte solution/Nonelectrolyte solution** - terms used to emphasize the solute.

## Separation

#### Decanting

1. 2 parts of the mixture are vertically separated.
2. The part on top is poured off.

#### Filtration

Used when there's a difference in solubility.

1. The liquid mixture is stirred to dissolve one component as much as possible.
2. The mixture is poured through a filter.
3. Solvent and dissolved components pass, everything else stays in the filter.

#### Chromatography

Very sensitive.
Relies on properties to absorb and stick to surfaces.
**Chromatogram** - dried support showing the separated components.

#### Distillation

Use when there's a difference in boiling points.

1. The mixture is heated.
2. The temperature is reached where one of the components starts to boil, while the other ones do not.
3. The desired component boils away, leaving the rest behind.
4. The desired component then condenses in a condenser.
