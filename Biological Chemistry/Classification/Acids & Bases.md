Widely used definition:
Brønsted-Lowry:
- **acid** - proton donor
- **base** - proton acceptor

## Acids

**Monoprotic** - acid releases 1 proton.
**Polyprotic** - acid releases multiple protons.

In inorganic acids, the acidic hydrogen is written first ($\ce{H2SO4}$), in organic acids, in carboxyl groups ($\ce{CH3COOH}$).

**Strong** - completely deprotonated (dissociated) in a solution.
**Weak** - incompletely deprotonated (dissociated) in a solution.

Strong acids: $\ce{HCl, \space HBr \space HI, \space HNO3, \space HClO4, \space HClO3, \space H2SO4} \space \text{(first proton)}$

All carboxylic acids are weak in water.

## Bases

**Strong** - completely dissociated in a solution.
**Weak** - incompletely dissociated in a solution.

Strong bases: $\text{Group 1 hydroxides, Group 1 and 2 oxides, } \ce{Ca(OH)2, \space Sr(OH)2, \space Ba(OH)2}$

**All amines are weak** in water.

Hydroxide ions are strong bases themselves:
$\ce{H2O (l) + OH- (aq) \rightleftharpoons OH- (aq) + H2O (l)}$
Water molecules and hydroxide ions interchange.

## Conjugated Acids & Bases

Every acid has a **conjugated base**, every base has a **conjugated acid**.
Strong acid/base → weak conjugated base/acid (and vice versa).

| Acid           | Conjugated Base | Base          | Conjugated Acid |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| $\ce{HCl}$     | $\ce{Cl-}$      | $\ce{NaOH}$   | $\ce{Na+}$      |
| $\ce{CH3COOH}$ | $\ce{CH3COO-}$  | $\ce{CH3NH2}$ | $\ce{CH3NH3+}$  |
A lot of the times, a compound can act both as an acid or a base, depending on the circumstances.
Thus, a lot of compounds have both a conjugated acid and a conjugated base at the same time.

| Compound      | Conjugated Acid | Conjugated Base  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| $\ce{H2O}$    | $\ce{H3O+}$     | $\ce{OH-}$       |
| $\ce{NH3}$    | $\ce{NH4+}$     | $\ce{NH2-}$      |
| $\ce{H2PO4-}$ | $\ce{H3PO4}$    | $\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$ |

> In general, when an acid reacts /w a base, the weakest acid & base are formed.
> $\ce{HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-}$

## Acid constant

$K_a$ - acid dissociation constant, how deprotonated the acid gets.
$K_a = \frac{\ce{[H+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}} \text{ for an acid } \ce{HA} \text{ in water}$

$\ce{[X]}$ - molar concentration of $\ce{X}$ at equilibrium.

High $K_a$ → stronger acid.
Low $K_a$ → weaker acid.

---
$pK_a$ - negative logarithm of $K_a$.
Easier to interpret (smaller values).
Used to determine if the reaction takes place.
**How basic the acid is in water**.
$pK_a = -log(K_a) = -log(\frac{\ce{[H+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}) = log(\frac{\ce{[HA]}}{\ce{[H+][A-]}})$

High $pK_a$ - weaker acid
Low $pK_a$ - stronger acid
![[pKa table.png]]
$\Delta pK_a = pK_a(\text{resulting acid}) - pK_a(\text{reactant acid})$
If $\Delta pK_a > 10$ → generally irreversible reaction, if $\leq 10$ → equilibrium.
If $\Delta pK_a > 0$ → equilibrium lies to the right side, if $< 0$ → to the left side **OR**
The side that has an acid /w higher $pK_a$ is favored.

Ex. 1
$\ce{HCl \rightleftharpoons H+ + Cl-}$ ($\ce{HCl + H2O \rightleftharpoons H3O+ + Cl-}$)
Reactant acid: $\ce{HCl}$, Resulting acid: $\ce{H+ (H3O+)}$
$\ce{HCl}$ - strong acid, low $pK_a \space (-7)$.
$\ce{H+ (H3O+)}$ - weaker acid, higher $pK_a \space (-1.7)$.
$\Delta pK_a = (-1.7) - (-7) = 5.3 > 0 \Rightarrow$ reaction equilibrium goes to the right.

Ex. 2
$\ce{CH3OH \rightleftharpoons H+ + CH3O-}$ ($\ce{CH3OH + H2O \rightleftharpoons H3O+ + CH3O-}$)
Reactant acid: $\ce{CH3OH}$, Resulting acid: $\ce{H+ (H3O+)}$
$\ce{CH3OH}$ - weak acid, high $pK_a \space (15.5)$.
$\ce{H+ (H3O+)}$ - stronger acid, lower $pK_a \space (-1.7)$.
$\Delta pK_a = (-1.7) - 15.5 = -17.2 < 0 \Rightarrow$ reaction equilibrium goes to the left.

Ex. 3
$\ce{HCl + NH3 -> Cl- + NH4+}$
Reactant acid: $\ce{HCl}$, Resulting acid: $\ce{NH4+}$
$pK_a(\ce{HCl}) = -6$
$pK_a(\ce{NH4+}) = 10$
$\Delta pK_a = 10 - (-6) = 16 > 10 > 0 \Rightarrow$ complete reaction (right side favored).

> When deciding the equilibrium, only the ions that are actually participating in the reaction make a difference! All the observer ions don't matter! Don't forget to decompose the compounds into ions when determining which acid/base is stronger as well!

Ex. 4
$\ce{NaCN + Na2HPO4 \rightleftharpoons Na3PO4 + HCN}$
Sodium does nothing here: $\ce{CN- + HPO4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons PO4^{3-} + HCN}$
Reactant acid: $\ce{HPO4^{2-}}$, Resulting acid: $\ce{HCN}$
$pK_a(\ce{HPO4^{2-}}) = 12.3$
$pK_a(\ce{HCN}) = 9.3$
$\Delta pK_a = 9.3 - 12.3 = -3 < 0 \Rightarrow$ equilibrium goes to the left.

Based on the first 2 examples, a rule can be formulated:
$pK_a < pH$ → deprotonation in water
$pK_a > pH$ → protonation in water

---

$pH = -log(\ce{[H+]})$
$pOH = -log([\ce{OH-}])$
$pH + pOH = 14$

$$
\begin{flalign}
&K_a = \frac{\ce{[H+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}} \\
&log(K_a) = log(\frac{\ce{[H+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}) = log(\ce{[H+]}) + log(\frac{\ce{[A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}) \\
&-log(K_a) = -log(\ce{[H+]}) - log(\frac{\ce{[A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}) \\
&pK_a = pH - log(\frac{\ce{[A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}}) \\
&pH = pK_a + log(\frac{\ce{[A-]}}{\ce{[HA]}})
&\end{flalign}
$$


## Equilibrium constant

$K_{eq} = \frac{\ce{[H+][A-]}}{\ce{[HA][H2O]}} = \frac{K_a}{\ce{[H2O]}}$

## History

Initially:
- acid - sour taste
- base - soapy feel

Svante Arrhenius's (Swedish) version (1884):
- acid - compound that reacts /w water to form $\ce{H+}$
- base - compound that reacts /w water to form $\ce{OH-}$

Ex.
- $\ce{HCl}$ - Arrhenius acid, $\ce{HCl + H2O -> H+ + Cl- + H2O}$
- $\ce{CH4}$ - **not** Arrhenius acid, $\ce{CH4 + H2O -/>}$
- $\ce{NaOH}$ - Arrhenius base, $\ce{NaOH + H2O -> Na+ + OH- + H2O}$
- $\ce{NH3}$ - Arrhenius base, $\ce{NH3 + H2O -> NH4+ + OH-}$
- $\ce{Na}$ - **not** Arrhenius base, not a compound

Thomas Lowry (English) & Johannes Brønsted (Danish) version (1923):
- acid - proton donor
- base - proton acceptor

A widely used definition today.

Ex.
$\ce{HCl (aq) + H2O (aq) -> H3O+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)}$
- $\ce{HCl}$ - Brønsted acid
- $\ce{H2O}$ - Brønsted base (in this example)
