## Addition

\# of atoms in molecule **increases**.
Multiple products can be formed, depending on the reactants.

$\ce{CH3-CH=CH2 + HBr -> CH3-CH2-CH2-Br}$

```smiles
C=CC.Br>>BrCCC
```
In the addition reaction between alkene/alkyne and $\ce{HHal}$, where the $\ce{H}$ goes is decided by:
[Markovnikov's rule]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markovnikov%27s_rule) - $\ce{H}$ goes where there are more $\ce{H}$s already.

Getting alcohol from an alkene (acid must catalyze):
$\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH3 ->[H2O/H+] CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3}$
```smiles
CC=CC.O>[H+]>CC(O)CC
```
## Elimination

\# of atoms in molecule **decreases**.

**Dehydration reaction (removing water)**:
$\ce{CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3 ->[H2O/H+, \text{heat}] CH3-CH=CH-CH3}$
```smiles
CC(O)CC>[H+]>CC=CC
```


## Condensation

2 reactant molecules stick together, one small molecule is cleaved off, usually $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{HCl, CH3CH2OH}$.

Ester formation (needs acid catalyst, $\ce{[H+]}$):
$\ce{R_1COOH + R_2OH \rightleftharpoons R_1COOR_2 + H2O}$

## Oxidation

**Not full oxidation (combustion)!**
**Bonds between the carbon atoms are not broken!**

Implication: hydrogen is removed.

>$\ce{[O]}$ - oxidant.

**Primary alcohols:** alcohol → aldehyde → carboxylic acid
**Secondary alcohols:** alcohol → ketone
**Tertiary alcohols: cannot be oxidized!**

$\ce{CH3CH2OH ->[{[O]}] CH3CHO ->[{[O]}] CH3COOH}$
```smiles
OCC>>O=CC
>>C(O)(=O)CC
```
```smiles
CC(O)C>>CC(=O)C
```

Oxidation of thiols:
$\ce{R-SH ->[{[O]}] R-S-S-R}$

## Hydrolysis

Adding water.
Implication: molecule cleaved in 2 by $\ce{H2O}$.
Needs either acid or base catalyst.

Acid hydrolysis - equilibrium reaction.
$\ce{R_1COOR_2 + H2O \rightleftharpoons R_1COOH + R_2OH}$

Basic hydrolysis (saponification) - irreversible reaction.
$\ce{R_1COOR_2 + H2O ->[OH-] R_1COO- + R_2OH}$
