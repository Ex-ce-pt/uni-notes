[acid](Acids%20&%20Bases.md#Acids) + [base](Acids%20&%20Bases.md#Bases) → salt

## Strong acid & strong base

Acid provides $\ce{H+}$, base provides $\ce{OH-}$, together they form water.

[acid](Acids%20&%20Bases.md#Acids) + [base](Acids%20&%20Bases.md#Bases) → salt + water

$\ce{HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) -> NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)}$

$\ce{NaCl}$ is soluble in water, so it stays as ions.

[Ionic equation](Chemical%20Equations#Ionic%20&%20Net%20Ionic%20Equations):
$\ce{H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + OH- (aq) -> Na+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) + H2O (l)}$

[Net ionic equation](Chemical%20Equations#Ionic%20&%20Net%20Ionic%20Equations):
$\ce{H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) -> H2O (l)}$

^ Net outcome of the reaction between a strong acid & a strong base.

## Weak acid/weak base

> In ionic reactions, weak acids/bases are **written as molecules**, because they don't dissociate completely in the solution!

$\ce{HCN (aq) + OH- (aq) -> H2O (l) + CN- (aq)}$
$\ce{NH3 (aq) + H+ (aq) -> NH4+ (aq)}$
