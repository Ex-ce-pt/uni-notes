Soluble electrolyte solutions mix → an insoluble electrolyte solid forms and precipitates.
All other ions stay in the solution.

Ex.
$\ce{AgNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) -> AgCl (s) + NaNO3 (aq)}$

What happens:
1. 2 solutions are prepared: solution of $\ce{AgNO3}$ and of $\ce{NaCl}$
2. Electrolytes dissolve, ion composition of the solutions: ($\ce{Ag+}$ & $\ce{NO3-}$) and ($\ce{Na+}$ & $\ce{Cl-}$)
3. Solutions are mixed together, ions in the result: $\ce{Ag+}$, $\ce{NO3-}$, $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{Cl-}$
4. Ions mingle together and eventually $\ce{Ag+}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$ find each other.
5. $\ce{AgCl}$ is insoluble, so it forms and precipitates, removing the $\ce{Ag+}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$ ions from the solution.
6. $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{NO3-}$ are left in the solution, $\ce{NaNO3}$ is soluble, so it stays dissolved as ions.

Precipitation reaction is useful to write as an [ionic or net ionic equation](Chemical%20Equations#Ionic%20&%20Net%20Ionic%20Equations).

Reaction used for:
- Qualitative analysis - confirm ions present in solution.
- Quantitative analysis - determine the amount of substance in solution.
- Gravimetric analysis - measuring the weight of the precipitate.
- Getting a compound as a precipitate and then [filtering](Mixtures%20&%20Solutions.md#Filtration).
