## Reaction Yield

**Theoretical yield** - max quantity of product from given quantity of reactant.
**Percentage yield** - fraction of the theoretical yield that's actually produced.

$\text{Percentage yield} = \frac{\text{Actual yield}}{\text{Theoretical yield}} \cdot 100\%$

## Limits of reaction

**Limiting reactant** - reactant on which the max yield of the product depends.

> Limiting reactant will be completely used up in the reaction, other reactants will have leftovers.

Calculation:
1. Compare how much reactants you have and you need to react /w each other **OR**
2. Compare how much of one particular product the reactants can form separately.
