Prediction of masses of reactants/products and volumes of solutions.

## Mole-to-mole

Given the balanced [chemical equation](Chemical%20Equations)
$\ce{N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) -> 2 NH3 (g)}$
We write
$1 \space mol \space \ce{N2} \equiv 3 \space mol \space \ce{H2}$ - 1 mol of $\ce{N2}$ is chemically equivalent to 3 mol of $\ce{N2}$.
$1 \space mol \space \ce{N2} \equiv 2 \space mol \space \ce{NH3}$ - 1 mol of $\ce{N2}$ is chemically equivalent to 2 mol of $\ce{NH3}$.

This can be used to convert the amount of one substance into the amount of other substances based on the equation.

$\frac{n(\ce{N2})}{n(\ce{H2})} = \frac{1 \space mol \space \ce{N2}}{1 \space mol \space \ce{H2}}$
$\frac{n(\ce{N2})}{n(\ce{NH3})} = \frac{1 \space mol \space \ce{N2}}{2 \space mol \space \ce{NH3}}$

## Mass-to-mass

1. Convert given mass into chemical amount.
2. Apply [[#Mole-to-mole]].
3. Convert back into the mass of the desired chemical.

## Volumetric Analysis

Determining concentration by measuring volume.

#### Titration

One [solution](Mixtures%20&%20Solutions) is gradually added to another.

Types:
- Acid-base
- Redox

**Analyte** - solution being analyzed (in a flask).
**Titrant** - solution being added (in a buret).

Known: $V_a$, $c_t$
Measure: $c_a$ or $m_a$
Process:
1. $V_a$ of the analyte is measured into a flask.
2. $V_{t1}$ of the titrant is taken into a buret.
3. The titrant is added bit by bit into the flask until the analyte stops reacting.
4. $V_{t2}$ is measured from the buret (the final volume reading).
5. $(V_{t1} - V_{t2})$ of the titrant was added in total.
6. $n_t = c_t \cdot (V_{t1} - V_{t2})$ - amount of titrant added.
7. $n_a = n_t \cdot \text{(mole ratio)}$ - amount of analyte that reacted (all $V_a$ of it), mole ratio comes from the chem. eq.
8. $c_a = \frac{n_a}{V_a}$ **OR** $m_a = n_a \cdot M_a$

**Equivalence point** - the actual point at which the chemicals stop reacting (e.g. equilibrium between $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ ions in acid-base titration).
**Endpoint** - the point at which a sudden measurable change happens that prompts the chemist to stop the titration process (e.g. indicator changing color).
