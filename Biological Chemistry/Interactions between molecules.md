The stronger the interactions, the higher the boiling point of the compound.
Interactions here are listed in decreasing order of force.

> Life is hard. Compounds almost always have multiple different interaction types (eg. when there's a [hydrogen bond](#Hydrogen%20bonding), there's necessarily a [dipole-dipole](#Dipole-dipole%20interaction) bond as well). What's usually important is which interaction is the strongest.

Solubility: solvent and solute must have the same type of intermolecular forces between them.

## Ionic bonding

Between charged atoms/molecules.
Described by the Coulomb's law.
High polarization → high attraction → high melting and boiling points

$\ce{NaCl} = \ce{Na+} + \ce{Cl-}$

## Hydrogen bonding

Very electronegative atom ($\ce{O, F, N}$) **directly** bonded to $\ce{H}$.
The bond is very polarized.
Dipoles between the molecules attract each other, holding the whole mass of the substance together.

## Dipole-dipole interaction

The principle is the same as in hydrogen bonding, but works /w any atoms.
Difference in electronegativity is not as large, the force is weaker as a result.

## Van der Waals dispersion forces (London forces)

**vdW**
Temporary dipole forces arising from coincidental gathering of electron(s) on one side of an atom, making it ever so slightly polar.
**VERY** weak.
Increases with the radius of the atom.
