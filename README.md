# University notes - Life Science

Here are the notes I took during the Life Science programme (Umeå University, 2025).
Have fun!

## Viewing the notes

The notes are taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so you'll need that to view them (any Markdown editor/viewer would suffice though). **Every folder here is a separate vault**.
Occasionally, I used the [Chem](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem) community plugin for rendering SMILES.
There might be some other files as well (e.g. GIMP images).
