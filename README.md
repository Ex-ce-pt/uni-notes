# University notes - Life Science, Umeå University 2025

Here are the notes I took during the **Life Science programme (Umeå University, 2025)**.

This is more of a personal archive, though I might potentially decide to share it with others. If you are reading this, you know already whether I ended up sharing it or not.

Have fun, I guess!

## Disclaimer

I did my best trying to understand and document to topics. I cannot, however, be sure that the information here is 100% correct. If you have found a mistake, please continue to the section **"Spotted a mistake?"** below.

Furthermore, if you are a student considering to use this information to learn, be aware that the curriculum might very well have changed and some topics or even entire courses might not be relevant to you any more.

Use this information at your own risk.

## Structure

Every top-level folder is dedicated to a specific course. Each of them is also its separate Obsidian vault (see the section **"Viewing the notes"** below).

Notes are organized by topics, not lectures! That means that if several lectures covered the same topic, the information in the notes will be intertwined to presend everything at once, not as it was presented during the lectures.

At the same time, the fact that different courses are in different folders means that the topics may repeat. For example, Lewis structures are covered in both "Biological Chemistry" and "Foundational Chemistry" courses.

Inside each top-level folder there is a folder called `_media`. This is where the figures of various sort used in the notes are stored.

## Viewing the notes

In order to take notes, i've used a couple of different apps/technologies. You might need to also use them to view the notes more comfortably.

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A popular open-source note-taking app. Almost all of the notes are written using it. Note: **Every top-level folder here is a separate vault bedicated to a separate course.**
- [Chem](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem) - A free community plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that I used to render SMILES in the notes. I did not use it much though, so you might be just fine without it.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - An open-source image editor. I have left some GIMP files, just in case I need to edit them, but all the images should be exported anyway, so you will be able to view them with a regular image viewer app instead.
- [Moldraw](https://moldraw.com/) - A free online editor of chemical structures, similar to infamous [Chemdraw](https://revvitysignals.com/products/research/chemdraw). The deal is the same as with the GIMP files - I have left some `.ket` files, but all of them must already be exported as images as well.
- There may be some other file formats as well, in case I missed something.

## Spotted a mistake?

If you spotted a mistake in the notes, want to add something, or want to change the order of information, feel free to open a pull request, open an issue, or contact me directly at `except.dice@gmail.com` or via other means, if you know me personally.

**Please, try not to leak my name, if end up contributing though.**
